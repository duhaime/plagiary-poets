["High on a rock that frowns o'er Eden's wave,</br>A youthful minstrel stood, in wild despair;</br>Loose flow'd his vest, and careless sorrow gave</br>His auburn ringlets to th' unconcious air!</br>Rude were his features, and his bosom bare;</br>Tears quench'd his eyes, that glisten'd erst with fire;</br>And as he tun'd the echoing notes of care,</br>Grief seem herself to animate his lyre,</br>To rouse the feeling swain, and every verse inspire.", "\"Mourn Edwin, mourn, thy rev'rend guardian dead!</br>He who thy breast from false desires redeem'd!</br>Cold is the hand which then thy footsteps led,</br>Clos'd are those eyes whence heav'nly pity beam'd,</br>Silent the heart which in his features gleam'd,</br>And mute, for ever mute, the genial tongue,</br>That tongue which inspiration's image seem'd,</br>Whilst on his lips celestial doctrines hung</br>And revelation will'd, the music that he sung!", "\"The warbling groves &mdash; the garniture of fields,</br>The solemn night &mdash; the blaze of perfect day!</br>All that the healthful dew of morning yields,</br>And all that echoes to the evening lay;</br>No more their Beattie's rural charms display!</br>For me &mdash; whose wand'ring heart his maxims drew,</br>From fancy's paths to reason's purer way;</br>Here, on his recent tomb I fix my view,</br>And pour my endless sighs, and weep my soul's adieu!", "\"Yet no! &mdash; hark!  'tis his voice!  'let those their doom</br>Deplore &mdash; whose hope is still their dark sojourn;</br>But lofty souls, who look beyond the tomb,</br>Can smile at fate, and wonder how they mourn!</br>Shall endless darkness shroud the stranger's bourne?</br>Shall man be born to vegetate in vain?</br>No! &mdash; Heav'n's immortal spring shall yet return,</br>And man's majestic beauty bloom again,</br>Bright thro' th' eternal years of love's triumphant reign!'\"</br>"]
