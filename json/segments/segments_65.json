["V.</br>Or on some bellying rock that shades the deep,</br>They view the lurid signs that cross the sky,</br>Where, in the west, the brooding tempests lie,</br>And hear their first, faint, rustling pennons sweep.</br>Or in the arched cave, where deep and dark</br>The broad, unbroken billows heave and swell,</br>In horrid musings rapt, they sit to mark</br>The labouring moon; or list the nightly yell</br>Of that dread spirit, whose gigantic form</br>The seer's entranced eye can well survey,</br>Through the dim air who guides the driving storm,</br>And points the wretched bark its destin'd prey.</br>Or him who hovers, on his flagging wing, </br>O'er the dire whirlpool, that, in ocean's waste,</br>Draws instant down whate'er devoted thing</br>The failing breeze within its reach hath plac'd&mdash;</br>The distant seaman hears, and flies with trembling haste.", "VI.</br>Or, if on land the fiend exerts his sway,</br>Silent he broods o'er quicksand, bog, or fen,</br>Far from the shelt'ring roof and haunts of men,</br>When witched darkness shuts the eye of day,</br>And shrouds each star that wont to cheer the night;</br>Or, if the drifted snow perplex the way,</br>With treach'rous gleam he lures the fated wight,</br>And leads him flound'ring on, and quite astray. . . .</br>"]
