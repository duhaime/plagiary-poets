["Here too a gentle Lass was sometimes seen,</br>Fair as the Hawthorn-Flow'r in bloom of May;</br>Who, tho' sage Pallas was her rightful Queen,</br>Yet oft at Idless' shrine would homage pay,</br>And loit'ring wast the livelong Hour away:</br>Her books and pen the while were thrown aside,</br>And rich Instruction all suspended lay.</br>Nathless, so meek and patient was her guide,</br>In vain he strove to frown and could as little chide.</br>"]
