["Is there a heart in such an hour as this,</br>When beauty gloweth in the firmament,</br>Which feels not something more than common bliss?&mdash;</br>As if heaven o'er the earth in kindness bent,</br>And kissed away its sorrows.  Love has lent</br>His gorgeous, richest colours, spreading far</br>As thought can follow in its wide extent.</br>Shot on the ethereal stream, each rising star</br>Brings home sweet thoughts to those who distant wandering are.</br>"]
