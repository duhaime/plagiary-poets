["Ah!  what avail the largest gifts of Heaven,</br>When drooping health and spirits go amiss?</br>How tasteless then whatever can be given!</br>Health is the vital principle of bliss,</br>And exercise of health!  In proof of this,</br>Behold the wretch, who slugs his life away,</br>Soon swallow'd in disease's dark abyss;</br>While he whom toil has brac'd, or manly play,</br>Has light as air each limb, each thought as clear as day.", "O who can speak the vigorous joys of health?</br>Unclogg'd the body, unobscur'd the mind;</br>The morning rises gay; with pleasing stealth,</br>The temperate evening falls serene and kind.</br>In health the wiser brutes true gladness, find;</br>See!  how the younglings frisk along the meads,</br>As May comes on, and wakes the balmy wind;</br>Rampant with life, their joy all joy exceeds?</br>Yet what but high strung health this dancing pleasaunce breeds?", "It was not by vile loitering in ease</br>That Greece obtain'd the brightest palm of art,</br>That soft yet ardent Athens learnt to please,</br>To point the wit, and to sublime the heart!</br>In all supreme!  complete in every part!</br>It was not thence majestic Rome arose,</br>And o'er the nations shook her conquering dart,</br>For sluggard's brow the laurel never grows!</br>Renown is not the child of indolent repose.", "Had listless mortals paid regard to nought</br>But in loose joy their time to wear away;</br>Had they alone the lap of dalliance sought,</br>Pleas'd on her pillow their dull heads to lay,</br>Rude nature's state had been our state to day;</br>No cities o'er their towery fronts had rais'd,</br>No arts had made us opulent and gay;</br>With brother brutes, the human race had grazed,</br>None e'er had soared to fame, none honor'd been, none praised.</br>"]
