["At Woodstock Park, in Ancient Time there stood</br>A goodly, aged Oak, itself a Wood,</br>Who to the Skies his stately Arms display'd,</br>Fam'd for his Airy Height, and Reverend Shade.</br>But now Old Age, (what will not Age consume!)</br>Blasted the Glory of his Youthful Bloom;</br>And He, who once reign'd Monarch of the Field,</br>Conquer'd by none but Time, is forc'd to yield.</br>He, who of late look'd o'er the Spacious Plain,</br>And view'd the Subject Shrubs with just Disdain,</br>Beneath whose Boughs the Cattle safely stood,</br>Furnish'd at once with Shelter, and with Food.</br>Who to the Farmer paid an annual Due,</br>As Tribute for the Ground on which he grew.</br>Now sees each rude, malicious blight Deface</br>His former Honours, and departing Grace.</br>Now the Grey Moss has marr'd his withering Rind,</br>And his bald Top's the Sport of every Wind.</br>Now pointed Blasts his batter'd Branches gore,</br>Which not the loudest Storm could shake before.", "An upstart Briar rose too near his Side,</br>Full of his Earth-born Self, and Swoln with Pride;</br>Which thrust his prickly Head, in vaunting wise,</br>Aloft in Air, and seem'd to threat the Skies.</br>Whose armed Leaves sweet Smelling Flowers adorn,</br>And opening Roses blossom on his Thorn.</br>Hither the Nymphs accustom'd to repair,</br>And gather Garlands for their Golden Hair.</br>Hither the little Birds would oft retreat,</br>And Warbling Tunes of Love or Grief repeat.</br>Linnets and Nightingales would hither fly,</br>With every Feather'd Poet of the Sky.</br>At this the foolish Briar conceited grew,</br>Pleas'd with the Birds who to his Bushes flew,</br>And proud of Flowers, which for the Ladies blew.</br>This puff'd him so, that he began to scold</br>At the Good Oak, because the Oak was old.", "What dost thou mean (quoth he) thou brutish Block,</br>The Ground to cumber with thy barren Stock,</br>No Shadow now thy Leafless Head bestows,</br>Nor the least Acorn on thy Branches grows.</br>See how my Flowers are with fresh Beauty spread,</br>Or dy'd in Lilly-white, or Rosy-red.</br>My lively Leaves are cloath'd in lusty Green,</br>A Colour worthy of a Maiden Queen.</br>While thy Waste, Bulky Body, (which so long</br>The Earth has bore, and groan'd beneath the Wrong)</br>Almost a Carcass, and scarce half alive,</br>Would me of all my springing Bloom deprive.</br>Hid are my Blossoms, and beclouded now,</br>By such a Useless, Worthless Thing as Thou.</br>The fragrant Odours which my Flourets threw,</br>Sweeter than Spicy Forests ever knew,</br>Are poison'd by your mouldy Moss, and you.</br>If then you would not my Displeasure prove,</br>Be gone, Old Trunk, and from this Green remove.", "Thus in contemptuous Strain the Bramble spoke,</br>Little reply'd the generous, suffering Oak.</br>But his vile Taunts with as much Courage bore,</br>As when he fought with Winds and Storms before.</br>Yet inwardly his Mighty Heart did bleed,</br>Thus to be snubb'd for every glorious Deed,</br>By a poor Shrub, a despicable Weed.", "It happen'd once upon a certain Day,</br>So Fate ordain'd, the Landlord came that Way,</br>As was his Custom, to Survey his Ground,</br>And mark his stately Trees in Compass round;</br>Which, fit for lopping, would most Gain produce,</br>And furnish Rafters for the Builder's Use:</br>Soon as the Briar kenn'd him from afar,</br>His Spight awaken'd, and reviv'd the War.</br>His Ancient Quarrel he remember'd still,</br>(For Malice has a Memory for Ill.)</br>To gain the Patron was his only Aim,</br>And rouze the dying Embers to a Flame.</br>For this the sturdy Oak he thus arraign'd,</br>And causlessly in formal Speech complain'd.</br>O my Liege Lord, on whom my Life depends,</br>(And then his suppliant, sneaking Head he bends,)</br>Ponder, I pray you, my complaining Moan</br>Of Wrongs, enough to move a very Stone:</br>Which your poor Vassal daily must endure,</br>Unless your Goodness brings a speedy Cure.</br>Grief will dispatch me, if this Oak proceed</br>To grow successful, and none curb his Speed.</br>If in Felonious Force he thus go on,</br>I, wretched I, am utterly undone.", "The Good Man, wounded with this piteous Plea,</br>Against an Ancient, Serviceable Tree,</br>Stood mute, and wonder'd what the Plaintiff meant;</br>But griev'd, and found his easie Heart relent,</br>For Pity's credulous, and the Distrest</br>Soon gain th' Ascendant on an honest Breast.</br>Go on, he cry'd, and in thy Tale proceed:</br>Then thus began this proud insulting Weed;</br>(As is the Custom of Ambitious Folk,)</br>His colour'd Crime with painted Words to cloke.", "Ah, my Dear Sovereign Lord, whose Favours fall</br>On every Plant, the Humble and the Tall,</br>Do not poor I, thy own Plantation, stand</br>As well as Oaks, the Monsters of thy Land?</br>I furnish Blossoms in the Vernal Prime,</br>And Scarlet Berries for the Summer Time;</br>How comes it then that this declining Oak,</br>Whose Trunk is sapless, and whose Arms are broke,</br>Whose naked Branches stretching to the Sky,</br>Should haughtily the flow'ring Briar defy?</br>Who darkens with his Shade my lovely Light,</br>And robs me of the Sun's refreshing Sight.</br>Oft from my Wounds the Blood is seen to slide,</br>His wither'd Boughs so beat my tender Side.</br>His hoary Locks on my fresh Flourets cast,</br>Before their Time, my Honours have defac'd.</br>For cruel Wrongs, and Outrages like these,</br>I only beg your Goodness would appease</br>The ranc'rous Rigour of his potent Spight,</br>Refrain his Rage, and do your Vassal Right.</br>To whom, unless your Patronage is just,</br>His Beauties soon will moulder in the Dust.</br>At this with worthy Indignation struck,</br>Th' undaunted Oak his lofty Branches shook,</br>Prepar'd an Answer, and to clear at large</br>His Honour from his Advesary's Charge.</br>But his foul Tongue us'd poorly to inform,</br>Had in the Landlord rais'd so high a Storm;</br>So much this Worm had wriggled in his Ear,</br>The Landlord could not, or He would not, hear,</br>But Home he hasted in a furious Heat,</br>Did Vows of Vengeance to himself repeat.</br>He bent the harmful Hatchet in his Hand,</br>(Ah, that the Hatchet should so ready stand!)</br>Impatient, to the Park alone he speeds,</br>(For little is the Help which Mischief needs.)</br>His silent Malice on the Tree to wreak,</br>For very Anger would not let him speak.</br>Then to the Root he bent his sturdy Stroak,</br>And gash'd with many a Wound the injur'd Oak.</br>The Ax recoil'd, as if th' unwilling Steel,</br>Relented at each Blow which made him reel.</br>Whether the conscious Iron was afraid,</br>And to his good Old Age just Reverence paid;</br>For it had been a very ancient Tree,</br>Sacred of Old, with many a Mystery.</br>Crost was it often by the Priestly Crew,</br>And hallow'd oft with Holy-water Dew.</br>But Priests in vain their Holy-water spent,</br>In vain to Heav'n their Prayers and Blessings sent.</br>Old Age will come, and with it sure Decay;</br>And what can drive the Dart of Fate away?</br>The Good Man labour'd at each hearty Blow:</br>The wounded Oak sigh'd at his Overthrow.</br>The Steel had pierc'd his Pith, and Truth to tell,</br>He gave a piteous Groan, and down he fell;</br>His wond'rous Weight made all the Park to quake,</br>The Ground shrunk under him, and seem'd to shake;</br>Prostrate he lyes upon his Native Earth,</br>Pitied by none but those who knew his Worth.", "Now Reigns the Bramble, like a Lord, alone,</br>Puff'd up with Pride, and like a Bladder blown.</br>Pert as a Pye, and as a Peacock gay,</br>And pleasant as the merry Month of May.</br>But Grief succeeding, sudden Mirth destroys,</br>And treads upon the Heels of hasty Joys.</br>Now Winter draws her stormy Legions forth,</br>And Blustering Boreas rages from the North.</br>By these the solitary Briar is torn,</br>Naked, abandon'd, helpless and forlorn.</br>In vain he seeks for some protecting Shade,</br>Dead is that Tree, to whom he flew for Aid.</br>Now he repents his foolish Pride too late,</br>And pities the good Oak's unworthy Fate:</br>The biting Frost nips all his Branches dead,</br>And showry Rains weigh down his feeble Head.</br>The heaped Snow now burdens him so sore,</br>His Strength is lost, and he can rise no more.</br>But prostrate laid, is trampled in the Dirt</br>By brouzing Cattle, and severely hurt.</br>For scorning reverend Age, this Fall he found,</br>Unpitied, spurn'd, and grov'ling on the Ground.", "So fare the Man, who fed with vain Desires,</br>By others Ruin, to be Great aspires,</br>And such the Fate of all Ambitious Briars!</br>"]
