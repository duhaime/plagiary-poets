["No more my Muse her shepherd's weeds shall wear,</br>But change her oaten-pipe for trumpets loud,</br>And sing of noble deeds which long have slept;</br>Fierce warrs and faithful loves shall grace my song:</br>Come, Holy Virgin!  chiefest of the nine</br>Assist my genius and inspire my theme.</br>A gentle Knight was riding on the plain,</br>In mighty arms and silver shield array'd,</br>Wherein appear'd old dints of deeper wounds;</br>His angry deed chiding the foaming bit</br>Disdain'd the curb:  a valiant knight he seem'd,</br>For noble deeds and fierce encounters form'd;</br>Upon his breast he bore a bloody cross,</br>The dear rememb'rance of his dying Lord,</br>Whom be ador'd as living evermore;</br>The Mark adorn'd his shield, emblem of Hope</br>Which in HIS help he had:  in deed and word</br>Faithful he was; yet seem'd oft'times afraid;</br>Fearful he seem'd yet dreaded was by all:</br>Pound on a mighty enterprize, conferr'd</br>By GLORIANA, Queen of Fairy-Land;</br>He long'd to prove his valor on his foe</br>A Dragon horrible:  beside him rode</br>A virtuous Lady on a snow-white steed,</br>Herself much fairer, veil'd her beauties were</br>And cover'd with a mourning robe, as one</br>That inly pin'd from some corroding woe:</br>A milk-white lamb she led, that emblem seem'd</br>Of her pure self; descended from old kings</br>That late had stretch'd their sceptres o'er the world,</br>'Till that foul fiend sore ravag'd all the land,</br>And cast them out from all their old domains:</br>Them to avenge, this knight from far she brought,</br>And him compell'd with the constraints of virtue</br>To rid her of her foe.  And as they went</br>The day with clouds was  suddenly o'ercast,</br>And angry JOVE an hideous storm of rain</br>So swiftly pour'd into his lover's lap,</br>That ev'ry traveller a shelter sought.</br>Not distant far they spied a shady grove,</br>Whose lofty trees bedeck'd with Summer's pride</br>Were spread so broad they hid the light of Heaven,</br>And shut out ev'ry star:  soon they arriv'd,</br>And ent'ring in found num'rous winding ways,</br>With footing worn, and leading inward far:</br>So on they pass'd, pleas'd with the harmony</br>Of various birds that shelter'd from the storm,</br>And seem'd in song to scorn the cruel sky:</br>Much did they praise the trees so straight and tall,</br>The sailing pine, the cedar's tow'ring top,</br>The vine prop'd elm, the poplar never dry,</br>The builder oak, (the sov'reign of the woods)</br>The aspine strong, the cypress funeral,</br>The laurel, (crown of mighty conquerors,</br>And poets sage) the fir that weepeth still,</br>The willow worn by disappointed love,</br>An oft by genius:  the obedient yew,</br>The birch for shafts, the sallow for the mill,</br>The myrrhe sweet bleeding in the bitter wound,</br>The warlike beach, the ash for nought unfit,</br>The fruitful olive and the round plantain,</br>The carver holme, the  maple seldom sound;</br>Delighted thus they still beguil'd their way</br>Until the storm was o'er, then sought return,</br>But sought in vain, so num'rous were the paths,</br>At length amidst the woods most deep recess</br>A cave they spy'd, 'twas ERROR'S hateful den,</br>Which well the lady knew, and to avoid</br>Advis'd the knight, but he unaw'd reply'd,</br>Eternal shame I ever should deserve</br>Now to recede, VIRTUE has light within,</br>Sufficient to illume her guiltless breast,</br>Amidst the thickest darkness VICE can form,</br>Then enter'd in with haste, his shining armour</br>Caus'd a small glimm'ring light, much like a shade,</br>By which he saw the ugly Monster plain,</br>Half like a serpent, half of woman's Shape</br>Most loathsome to behold:  outstretch'd she lay,</br>Her huge long tail with many knots upwound</br>O'erspread the den, pointed with mortal sting:</br>Upon her breasts a thousand young she bore</br>Whom she sustain'd each day, various their shapes,</br>Yet each appear'd most horrid to the view.</br>Soon as th' unusual light upon them shone</br>They crept into her mouth and kennel'd there:</br>At sight of human form their dam rush'd forth</br>Curling her hideous tail around her head,</br>But swift recoil'd for she could ne'er endure </br>The smallest gleam of light, which when he saw</br>He flew as lions on their fearful prey,</br>Nor suffer'd her retreat:  then much incens'd</br>She roar'd so loud, that all the gloomy cave</br>Resounded horrible:  and turning fierce,</br>Advanc'd her speckled tail, threat'ning her sting:</br>But he all undismay'd up-rais'd his hand</br>And from her head unto her shoulders glanc'd:</br>At which inrag'd, she leap'd upon his shield</br>And curl'd her train around him many a fold;</br>Now when his lady; saw, she pitying said </br>Soon will your fortitude and grace be prov'd,</br>Add faith to force and be not ought afraid:</br>He heard, and all on fire to be unloos'd,</br>Exerting all his might be seiz'd her throat,</br>And caus'd her soon to quit her devilish hold.</br>Then from her filthy mouth such poison ran,</br>Whole floods of nauseous books and papers vile,</br>With loathsome frogs and toads, all wanting eyes,</br>Which forc'd him back, nor could he longer fight;</br>Chear'd with success (such chear us can arise</br>In spirits debas'd) she pour'd forth her spawn,</br>Like living creatures on the banks of Nile;</br>These clung around the knight, but hurt him not,</br>No more than cum'brous gnats annoy the swain</br>Who marks his num'rous flocks at even-tide,</br>When ruddy PHOEBUS 'gins to set in West,</br>For soon with clownish hands he strikes them off</br>Marring their murmurs.  So this virtuous knight</br>Treated the monsters that from ERROR sprang,</br>And her he smote with more than manly force</br>(So GOD him aided) that her head straight fell</br>From off her wicked corse, from whence black blood</br>Distain'd the ground; her scatter'd brood stood round;</br>And sought their wonted entrance, that deny'd</br>They suck'd her blood and thence receiv'd new strength;</br>New strength it seem'd, but death it prov'd, to all.</br>This virtuous pair then took their lonely way,</br>Thro' num'rous paths that almost endless seem'd;</br>At last the chearful rays of light appear'd</br>And their glad eyes rehail'd the splendid sun,</br>Engag'd in fit discourse, they journey'd on</br>And as they went they met a rev'rend man;</br>His feet all hare, his head all hoary grey,</br>In sober sadness low he bent his eyes,</br>Nor ought malicious seem'd:  and praying walk'd,</br>To whom the the Knight, when salutations o'er,</br>Know you of ought that seeks a quick redress?</br>Then thus he answerer'd, how can ancient man</br>That all day tells his beads, and fits his soul</br>For future scenes, know what afflicts the world?</br>Yet can I tell yon of a wicked man</br>Who wastes the country in a desert wild,</br>Far hence he dwells secure; haste then reply'd</br>The valorous man, but she his better guide</br>Intreated him to rest, tarry all night</br>She said, and on the morrow you shall pass,</br>Even the Sun that measures Heav'n all day</br>At night sets up his steeds among the waves.</br>So by the godly man's advice they went</br>To his low cottage, far from mortal foot,</br>Down in a dale, hard by a forest's side,</br>A little distant stood the holy house</br>Where he was wont to pray at morn and eve,</br>A crystal fountain innocently play'd</br>And seem'd to sooth the weary'd travellers,</br>Rest was their feast, and all things at their will,</br>The noblest mind the best contentment has:</br>In fair discourse the ev'ning slid away,</br>For the old man of pleasing words had store,</br>His tongue like glass, of saints and popes he talk'd,</br>And ave-marias evermore he strew'd:</br>Then rest they sought, with labor overcome</br>And the sad drowsy humor fill'd their eyes,</br>As if the messenger of sleep had thrown</br>His velvet mantle o'er them; whilst their host</br>Try'd magic spells to wake black PLUTO'S dame,</br>And call'd on GORGON, prince of shades and night,</br>At which Styx flees and bold Cocytus quakes:</br>Nor did he fear to curse the LORD of LIFE.</br>Then from the dread deep darkness he invok'd</br>Legions of spirits, which like little flies</br>Flutt'ring around him, instant sought his will;</br>Of these he chose out two, the falsest two,</br>The one he kept, the other wing'd with speed</br>He sent thro' yielding air, and thro' the world:</br>Of waters wide and deep, to MORPHEUS' house;</br>Within the earth's deep womb where day ne'er comes</br>His dwelling is, where TETHYS his wet bed</br>Doth ever wash, and where the moon still steeps</br>His ever drooping head in silver dew;</br>Whilst baleful night her sable mantle spreads:</br>The double gates he found fast lock'd and:  barr'd,</br>And wakeful dogs before them watching still,</br>To banish care, that, enemy to; sleep</br>Deep drown'd in deepest sleep he MORPHEUS finds,</br>A trickling stream from high rock falling down</br>And ever drifting rain upon the top.</br>Mixt with a murm'ring wind like swarming bees</br>For ever lull'd him; noise ne'er enters there,</br>But Quiet wrap'd in silence listless lies:</br>The spirit then in haste his message told,</br>But his waste words return'd to him in vain</br>For MORPHEUS slept as if to wake no more.</br>At last, as one that dreams, whose brain is tost,</br>He mutter'd softly, till he heard the name</br>Of HECATE; then his heavy head 'gan quake</br>And hastily he ask'd, what bus'ness caus'd</br>Such rude uproar?  then thus the messenger,</br>He that the stubborn spirits instant tames</br>By name ARCHIMAGO, has sent me here,</br>And straight commands a dream that can delude</br>The sleeper's keenest scent; a dream most fit</br>To lull the ear of Virtue, and seduce</br>The cautious pilgrim to the paths of Folly:</br>The god obey'd, and. straightway call'd a dream</br>Out of his darksome den, and gave to him:</br>Immediate then reclin'd his drowsy head,</br>Sunk as before in ever careless sleep:</br>Swift to his lord the spirit bore the dream</br>Upon his little wings, as soars the lark</br>To meet Heav'n's clearest light:  his guileful lord</br>Meanwhile with secret charms and hidden wiles</br>Had made a lady of the other spirit,</br>Of liquid air so delicately form'd</br>And lovely to behold, it almost caught</br>The maker's sense:  so worshippers of old</br>Ador'd the idol which their hands had made.</br>This form he clad in white, and a long robe</br>Of mournful hue he gracefully bestow'd,</br>Most like to virtuous UNA it appear'd:</br>Now when the treach'rous dream was to him brought,</br>He taught the spirit, and the new form'd fair</br>How to deceive the knight, who slept secure,</br>No evil fearing, as intending none;</br>His fancy now disturb'd with wanton dreams,</br>He thought his lady at his ear complain'd</br>That false wing'd CUPID had subdu'd her heart,</br>And made her stubborn virtue almost yield:</br>And VENUS queen of beauty there appear'd,</br>And all the Graces sung in softest air</br>And FLORA crown'd her with an ivy wreath,</br>Whilst HYMEN ever youthful, danc'd around:</br>He waking soon as one in great amaze</br>Saw her whom he esteem'd his sole delight;</br>Then thus she said, ah!  Sir, my only lord</br>Shall I accuse the hidden cruel fates</br>Of highest Heav'n?  or the blind god of love</br>That thus I tell what else were never known?</br>How your dear sake forc'd me at first to leave</br>My father's throne; then as one choak'd with tears</br>Her speech she stopt, but soon resum'd her plaint;</br>My weaker years said she intreat your aid,</br>Let me not die with sorrow thus opprest;</br>To whom the knight with innocence reply'd,</br>Why what should now dismay your virtuous mind,</br>You that was frequent wont to comfort me?</br>Love of yourself (she said) forbids my peace</br>And makes me waste the night in fruitless sighs.</br>Her words awake within his candid breast</br>A strange suspicion of her virgin truth;</br>Yet as he knew no ill, he would not spurn</br>Her seeming love, but sought her to console</br>By softest words which thus with grace he spoke:</br>Let not vain fears disturb your wish'd repose,</br>For be assur'd as life is to my heart</br>So dear I hold your love, and think myself</br>Bound to your service by the tenderest ties.</br>As one not quite content, yet much appeas'd,</br>Whilst hope fresh dawns upon the troubled mind,</br>She slid away, as tho' she sought to rest:</br>Long time he mus'd on this adventure strange,</br>Much griev'd to think her virtue was so weak:</br>At length in sleep's soft arms he sunk again.</br>"]
