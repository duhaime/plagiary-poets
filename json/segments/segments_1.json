plough, to plant, to reap, to rake, to sow,</br>To hedg, to ditch, to thresh, to thatch, to mow;</br>Or to what Labour else he was prepar'd?</br>For Husband's Life is labourous and hard.", "When-as the Ape him heard so much to talk</br>Of Labour, that did from his liking balk,</br>He would have slipt the Coller handsomly,</br>And to him said; Good Sir, full glad am I</br>To take what pains may any living Wight:</br>But my late maimed Limbs lack wonted Might</br>To do their kindly Services, as needeth:</br>Scarce this right Hand the Mouth with Diet feedeth,</br>So that it may no painful Work

may me trust as your own ghostly Father.", "With that, the Husband-man 'gan him avize,</br>That it for him was fittest Exercise</br>Cattle to keep, or Grounds to over-see;</br>And asked him if he could willing be</br>To keep his Sheep, or to attend his Swine,</br>Or watch his Mares, or take his charge of Kine?", "Gladly (said he) whatever such like Pain</br>Ye put on me, I will the same sustain:</br>But gladliest I of your fleecy Sheep</br>(Might it you please) would take on me to keep.</br>For ere that unto Arms I me betook,</br>Unto my Father's Sheep I us'd to look,</br>That yet the Skill thereof I have not lost</br>There-to right well this Curdog by my cost,</br>(Meaning the Fox) will serve, my Sheep to gather,</br>And drive to follow after their Belwether.", "The Husband-man was meanly well content,</br>Tryal to make of his Endeavourment,</br>And home him leading, lent to him the charge</br>Of all his Flock, with liberty full large,</br>Giving account of the Annual Increase</br>Both of their Lambs, and of their woolly Fleece.", "Thus is this Ape become a Shepherd Swain,</br>And the false Fox his Dog, (God give them pain)</br>For, ere the Year have half

frame,</br>Ne how to scape great Punishment, or Shame,</br>For their false Treason and vile Thievery.</br>For, not a Lamb of all their Flocks Supply</br>Had they to shew; but ever as they bred,</br>They slew them, and upon their Fleshes fed:</br>For that disguised Dog lov'd Blood to spill,</br>And drew the wicked Shepherd to his Will.</br>So twixt them both they not a Lamkin left,</br>And when Lambs fail'd, the old Sheeps Lives they reft;</br>That how t' acquit themselves unto their Lord,</br>They were in doubt, and flatly set abord.</br>The Fox then counsel'd th' ape, for to require</br>Respite till Morrow, t' answer his Desire:</br>For time's delay new Hope of Help still breeds.</br>The good Man granted, doubting nought their Deeds,</br>And bade, next Day that all should ready be.</br>But they more subtil meaning had than he:</br>For the next Morrow's Meed they closely ment,</br>For fear of Afterclaps for to prevent.</br>And that same Evening, when all shrouded were</br>In careless Sleep, they without Care or Fear,</br>Cruelly fell upon their Flock in Fold,</br>And of them slew at pleasure what they wold:</br>Of which, when as they feasted had their fill,</br>For a full Complement of all their Ill,</br>They stole away, and took their hasty flight,</br>Carry'd in Clouds of all-concealing Night.</br>So was the Husband-man left to his Loss,</br>And they unto their Fortune's change to toss.</br>After which sort they wandered long while,</br>Abusing many through their cloaked Guile;</br>That at the last they 'gan to be descry'd</br>Of every one,

some other way to gain by giving:</br>Much like to Begging, but much better named;</br>For many beg, which are thereof ashamed.</br>And now the Fox had gotten him a Gown,</br>And th' Ape a Cassock side-long hanging down;</br>For they their Occupation meant to change,</br>And now in other state abroad to range:</br>For, since their Souldier's Pass no better sped,</br>They forg'd another, as for Clerks Book-red.</br>Who passing forth, as their Adventures fell,</br>Through many haps, which needs not here to tell;</br>At length chanc'd with a formal Priest to meet,</br>Whom they in civil Manner first did greet,</br>And after askt an Alms for God's dear Love.</br>The Man straight-way his Choler up did move,</br>And with reproachful Terms 'gan them revile,</br>For following that Trade so base and vile;</br>And askt what Licence, or what Pass they had?</br>Ah (said the Ape as sighing wondrous sad)</br>It's an hard case, when Men of good deserving</br>Must either driven be perforce to sterving,</br>Or asked for their Pass by every Squib,</br>That list at will them to revile or snib:</br>And yet (God wote) small odds I often see</br>'Twixt them that ask, and them that asked be.</br>Nath'less, because you shall not us misdeem,</br>But that we are as honest as we seem,</br>Ye shall our Pasport at your pleasure see,</br>And then ye will (I hope) well moved be.</br>Which when the Priest beheld, he view'd it nere,</br>As if therein some Text he studying were;</br>But little else (God wote) could thereof skill:</br>For, read he could not Evidence, nor Will,</br>Ne tell a written Word, ne write a Letter,</br>Ne make one Tittle worse, ne make one better:</br>Of such deep Learning little had he need,</br>Ne yet of Latin, ne of Greek, that breed</br>Doubts mongst Divines, and difference of Texts,</br>From whence arise diversity of Sects,</br>And hateful Heresies of God abhor'd:</br>But this good Sir did follow the plain Word,</br>Ne medled with their Controversies vain,</br>All his care was, his Service well to fain,</br>And to read Homelies on Holy-days,</br>When that was done, he might attend his Plays;</br>An easy Life, and fit high God to please.</br>He, having over-lookt their Pass at ease,</br>'Gan at the length them to rebuke again,</br>That no good trade of Life did entertain,</br>But lost their time in wandring loose abroad;</br>Seeing the World, in which they bootless boad,</br>Had ways enow for all therein to live;</br>Such Grace did God unto his Creatures give.", "Said then the Fox; Who hath the World not tride,</br>From the right way full eath may wander wide:</br>We are but Novices new come abroad,</br>We have not yet the tract of any troad,</br>Nor on us taken any state of Life,</br>But ready are of any to make prief.</br>Therefore, might please you, which the World have proved,</br>Us to advise, which forth but lately moved,</br>Of some good Course, that we might undertake:</br>Ye shall for ever us your Bondmen make.", "The Priest 'gan wex half proud to be so praid,</br>And thereby willing to afford them aid;</br>It seems (said he) right well that ye be Clerks,</br>Both by your witty Words, and by your Werks.</br>Is not that Name enough to make a Living</br>To him that hath a whit of Nature's giving?</br>How many honest Men see ye arise</br>Daily thereby, and grow to goodly Prize?</br>To Deans, to Archdeacons, to Commissaries,</br>To Lords, to Principals, to prebendaries;</br>All jolly Prelates, worthy Rule to bear,</br>Who ever them envie:  yet Spite bites near.</br>Why should you doubt then, but that ye likewise</br>Might unto some of those in time arise?</br>In the mean time to live in good Estate,</br>Loving that love, and hating those that hate;</br>Being some honest Curate, or some Vicar,</br>Content with little in Condition sicker.", "Ah!  but (said th' ape) the Charge is wondrous great,</br>To feed Mens Souls, and hath an heavy Threat,</br>To feed Mens Souls (quoth he) is not in Man;</br>For, they must feed themselves, do what we can,</br>We are but charg'd to lay the Meat before:</br>Eat they that list, we need to do no more.</br>But God it is that feeds them with his Grace,</br>The Bread of Life pour'd down from heavenly Place,</br>Therefore said he that with the budding Rod</br>Did rule the Jews, All shall be taught of God.</br>That same hath Jesus

Hair.</br>Beside, we may have lying by our sides</br>Our lovely Lasses, or bright shining Brides;</br>We be not tyde to wilful Chastity,</br>But have the Gospel of free Liberty.", "By that he ended had his ghostly Sermon,</br>The Fox was well enduc'd to be a Parson;</br>And of the Priest eftsoons 'gan to enquire,</br>How to a Benefice he might aspire.</br>Marry there (said the Priest) is Art indeed;</br>Much good deep Learning one thereout may reed:</br>For, that the Ground-work is, and End of all,</br>Bow to obtain a Beneficial.</br>First therefore, when ye have in handsom wise,</br>Your selves attired, as you can devise,</br>Then to some Noble Man your self apply,</br>Or other Great One in the Worldes Eye,</br>That hath a zealous Disposition</br>To God, and so to his Religion:</br>There must thou fashion eke a godly Zeale,</br>Such as no Carpers may contrayr reveale:</br>For, each thing fained ought more wary be,</br>There thou must walk in sober Gravitie,</br>And seem as Saint-like as Saint Radegund;</br>Fast much, pray oft, look lowly on the ground,</br>And unto every one do Curtesie meek.</br>These Looks (nought saying) do a Benefice seek,</br>And be thou sure one not to lack ere long.</br>But if thee list unto the Court to throng,</br>And there to hunt after the hoped Prey,</br>Then must thou thee dispose another way:</br>For there thou needs must learn to laugh, to lye,</br>To face, to forge, to scoff, to company,</br>To crouch, to please, to be a Beetle-stock</br>Of thy great Master's Will, to scorn, to mock:</br>So maist thou chance mock out a Benefice,</br>Unless thou canst one conjure by Device,</br>Or cast a Figure for a Bishoprick:</br>And if one could, it were but a School-trick.</br>These be the ways by which without reward</br>Livings in Courts be gotten, though full hard.</br>For nothing there is done without a Fee:</br>The Courtier needs must recompenced be</br>With a Benevolence, or have in gage</br>The Primitias of your Parsonage:</br>Scarce can a Bishoprick forpass them by,</br>But that it must be gelt in privily.</br>Do not thou therefore seek a Living there,</br>But of more private Persons seek elsewhere,</br>Whereas thou mayst compound a better peny,</br>Ne let thy Learning question'd be of any.</br>For some good Gentleman that hath the right</br>Unto his Church for to present a Wight,</br>Will cope with thee in reasonable wise;</br>That if the Living yearly do arise</br>To forty Pound, that then his youngest Son</br>Shall twenty have, and twenty thou hast won:</br>Thou has it won, for it is of frank Gift,</br>And he will care for all the rest to shift;</br>Both, that the Bishop may admit of thee,</br>And that therein thou maist maintained be.</br>This is the way for one that is unlearn'd</br>Living to get, and not to be discern'd.</br>But they that are great Clerks, have nearer ways,</br>For Learning-sake to Living them to raise:</br>Yet many eke of them (God wote) are driven,</br>T' accept a Benefice in pieces riven.</br>How sayst thou (Friend) have I not well discourst</br>Upon this Common-place (though plain, not wourst)?</br>Better a short Tale, than a bad

led.</br>But th' Ape and Fox e'er long so well them sped,</br>Through the Priest's wholesom Counsel lately taught,</br>And through their own fair handling wisely wrought,</br>That they a Benefice 'twixt them obtained;</br>And crafty Reynold was a Priest ordained;</br>And th' Ape his Parish-Clark procur'd to be:</br>Then made they Revel-rout, and goodly Glee.</br>But e'er long time had passed, they so ill</br>Did order their Affairs, that th' Evil-will</br>Of all their Parish'ners they had constrain'd;</br>Who to the Ordinary of them complain'd,</br>How foully they their Offices abus'd,</br>And them of Crimes and Heresies accus'd;</br>That Pursivants he often for them sent:</br>But they neglecting his Commandement,</br>So long persisted obstinate and bold,</br>Till at the length he published to hold</br>A Visitation, and them cited thether:</br>Then was high time their Wits about to gether;</br>What did they then, but made a Composition</br>With their next neighbour

might them surprize,</br>And after that long strayed here and there,</br>Through every Field and Forest far and near;</br>Yet never found occasion for their tourn,</br>But almost sterv'd, did much

Turret hie,</br>From whence he views with his black-lidded Eye,</br>What-so the Heaven in his wide Vault contains,</br>And all that in the deepest Earth remains,</br>And troubled Kingdom of wild Beasts beheld,</br>Whom not their kindly Sovereign did weld,</br>But an usurping Ape with Guile suborn'd,</br>Had all suberst; he sdeignfully it scorn'd</br>In his great Heart, and hardly did refrain,</br>But that with Thunderbolts he had him slain,</br>And driven down to Hell, his duest Meed:</br>But him avising, he that dreadful Deed</br>Forbore, and rather chose, with scornful Shame,</br>Him to avenge, and blot his brutish Name</br>Unto the World, that never after any</br>Should of his Race be void of infamy:</br>And his false Counsellor, the Cause of all,</br>To damn to Death, or Dole perpetual,</br>From whence he never should be quit, nor stall'd.</br>Forth-with he Mercury unto him call'd,</br>And bade him fly with never-resting speed</br>Unto the Forrest, where wild Beasts do breed;</br>And there enquiring privily, to learn</br>What did of late chance to the Lion stearn,</br>That he rul'd not the Empire, as he ought;</br>And whence were all those Plaints unto him brought</br>Of Wrongs and Spoils by salvage Beasts committed:</br>Which done, he bade the Lion be remitted</br>Into his Seat, and those same Treachours vile</br>Be punished for their presumptuous Guile.</br>The Son of Maia, soon as he receiv'd</br>That word, straight with his azure Wings he cleav'd</br>The liquid Clouds and lucid Firmament;</br>Ne staid, till that he came with steep Descent</br>Unto the Place, where his Prescript did show.</br>There stouping like an Arrow from a Bow,</br>He soft arrived on the grassie Plain,</br>And fairly paced forth with easie Pain,</br>Till that unto the Palace nigh he came.</br>Then 'gan he to himself new Shape to frame,</br>And that fair Face, and that Ambrosial Hue,</br>Which wonts to deck the Gods immortal Crew,</br>And beautifie the shiny Firmament,</br>He doft, unfit for that rude Rabblement.</br>So standing by the Gates in strange Disguize,</br>He 'gan enquire of some in secret wize,</br>Both of the King and of his Government,</br>And of the Fox, and his false Blandishment:</br>And evermore he heard each one complain</br>Of foul Abuses both in Realm and Raign.</br>Which yet to prove more true, he meant to see,</br>And an Eye-witness of each thing to be.</br>Tho, on his Head his dreadful Hat he dight,</br>Which maketh him invisible to sight,</br>And mocketh th' Eyes of all the Lookers on,</br>Making them think it but a Vision.</br>Through Power of that, he runs through Enemies Swerds;</br>Through Power of that, he passeth through the Herds</br>Of ravenous wild Beasts, and doth beguile</br>Their greedy Mouths of the expected Spoil;</br>Through Power of that, his cunning Thieveries</br>He wonts to work, that none the same espies;</br>And through the Power of that, he putteth on</br>What Shape he list in Apparition.</br>That on his Head he wore; and in his Hand</br>He took Caduceus his snaky Wand,</br>With which the damned Ghosts he governeth,</br>And Furies rules, and Tartare tempereth.</br>With that he causeth Sleep to seize the Eyes,</br>And Fear the Hearts of all his Enemies;</br>And when him list, an universal Night,</br>Throughout the World he makes on every Wight,</br>As when his Sire with Alcumena lay,</br>Thus dight, into the Court he took his way,</br>Both through the Gard, which never him descride,</br>And through the Watchmen, who him never spide:</br>Thence, forth he past into each secret part,</br>Whereas he saw (that sorely griev'd his Hart)</br>Each place abounding with foul Injuries,</br>And fill'd with Treasure rack'd with Robberies:</br>Each place defil'd with Blood of guiltless Beasts,</br>Which had been slain to serve the Ape's Beheasts:</br>Gluttony, Malice, Pride, and Covetize;</br>And Lawlesness reigning with Riotize;</br>Besides the infinite Extortions</br>Done through the Fox's great Oppressions,</br>That the Complaints thereof could not be told.</br>Which when he did with loathful Eyes behold,</br>He would no more endure, but came his way,</br>And cast to seek the Lion where he may,</br>That he might work th' Avengement for his Shame,</br>On those two Caitives which had bred him Blame.</br>And seeking all the Forest busily,</br>At last he found, where sleeping he did lie;</br>The wicked Weed, which there the Fox did lay,</br>From underneath his Head he took away,</br>And then him waking, forced up to rise.</br>The Lion looking up, 'gan him avize,</br>As one late in a trance, what had if long</br>Become of him; for Fantasie is strong.</br>Arise (said Mercury) thou sluggish Beast,</br>That here liest sensless, like the Corpse deceast,</br>The whilst thy Kingdom from thy Head is rent,</br>And thy Throne Royal with Dishonour blent:</br>Arise, and do thy self redeem from Shame,</br>And be aveng'd on those that breed thy Blame.</br>There-at enraged, soon he 'gan up-start,</br>Grinding his Teeth, and grating his great Hart;</br>And rouzing up himself, for his rough Hide</br>He 'gan to reach, but no where it espide.</br>There-with he 'gan full terribly to roar,</br>And chauft at that Indignity right sore.</br>But when his Crown and Scepter both he wanted,</br>Lord how he fum'd, and swell'd, and rag'd, and panted;</br>And threatned Death, and thousand deadly Dolours</br>To them that had purloin'd his Princely Honours!</br>With that in haste, disrobed as he Was,</br>He towards his own Palace forth did pass;</br>And all the way he roared as he went,</br>That all the Forrest with Astonishment</br>Thereof did tremble, and the Beasts therein</br>Fled fast away from that so dreadful Din.</br>At last, he came unto his Mansion,</br>Where all the Gates he found fast lockt anon,</br>And many Warders round about them stood.</br>With that he roar'd aloud, as he were wood,</br>That all the Palace quaked at the Stound,</br>As if it quite were riven from the Ground,</br>And all within were dead and heartless left;</br>And th' Ape himself, as one whose Wits were reft,</br>Fled here and there, and every Corner sought,</br>To hide himself from his own feared Thought.</br>But the false Fox, when he the Lion heard,</br>Fled closely forth, straightway of Death afear'd,</br>And to the Lion came full lowly creeping,</br>With fained Face, and watry Eyn half weeping,</br>T' excuse his former Treason and Abusion,</br>And turning all unto the Ape's Confusion:</br>Nath'less, th' Royal Beast forbore believing,</br>But bade him stay at ease till further prieving.</br>Then when he saw no Entrance to him graunted,</br>Roaring yet louder that all Hearts it daunted,</br>Upon those Gates with Force he fiercely flew,</br>And rending them in pieces, felly slew</br>Those Warders strange, and all that else he met.</br>But th' Ape still flying, he no where might get;</br>From Room to Room, from Beam to Beam he fled</br>All breathless, and for fear now almost ded:</br>Yet him at last the Lion spide, and caught,</br>And forth with Shame unto his Judgment brought.</br>Then all the Beasts he caus'd assembled be,</br>To hear their Doom, and sad Ensample see.</br>The Fox, first Author of that Treachery,</br>He did uncase, and then away let fly:</br>But th' Ape's long Tail (which then he had) he quite</br>Cut off, and both Ears pared of their height;</br>Since which, all Apes but half their Ears have left,</br>And of their Tails are utterly bereft.", "So Mother Hubberd her Discourse did end</br>Which pardon me, if I amiss have pen'd;</br>For, weak was my Remembrance it to hold,</br>And bad her Tongue that it so bluntly
