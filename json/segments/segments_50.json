["Hail!  blooming Spring, thou herald of the year;</br>In whose coat armour gloriously array'd</br>The blazon'd colours of all flowers appear;</br>Their buds are open'd and their tints display'd.", "CLARINDA, then, no longer hesitate;</br>Nor waste on anxious thoughts thy beauties prime!</br>The SPRING of life to love we'll dedicate;</br>And happiness shall triumph over TIME!</br>"]
