["Here rests his Head upon the Lap of Earth,</br>One not to Fortune nor to Fame unknown;</br>Fair Science frown'd not on his humble Birth,</br>And smooth-tongued Flatt'ry mark'd him for her own.", "Large was his Wish &mdash; in this he was sincere,</br>Fate did a Recompence as largely send,</br>Gave the poor C&mdash;r Four Hundred Pounds a Year,</br>And made a d&mdash;y Minister his Friend.", "No further seek his Deeds to bring to Light,</br>For, ah!  he offer'd at Corruption's Shrine;</br>And basely strove to wash an Ethiop white,</br>While Truth and Honour bled in ev'ry Line.</br>"]
