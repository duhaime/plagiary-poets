["Here rests his head upon the lap of earth</br>One nor to Fortune nor to Fame unknown;</br>Fair Science frown'd not on his humble Birth,</br>And smooth-tongued Flattery mark'd him for her own.", "Large was his wish &mdash; in this he was sincere,</br>Fate did a recompence as largely send,</br>Gave the poor C&mdash;r four hundred pounds a year</br>And made a dirty minister his friend.", "No further seek his deeds to bring to light</br>For, ah!  he offer'd at Corruption's shrine;</br>And basely strove to wash an Aethiop white,</br>While Truth and Honour bled in every line!</br>"]
