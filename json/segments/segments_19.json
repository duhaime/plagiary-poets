["Full many a fiend did haunt this house of rest,</br>And made of passive wights an easy prey.</br>Here Lethargy, with deadly sleep oppress't,</br>Stretch'd on his back, a mighty lubbard lay,</br>Heaving his sides; and snored night and day.</br>To stir him from his traunce it was not eath,</br>And his half-open'd eyne he shut straightway:</br>He led I ween the softest way to death,</br>And taught withouten pain or strife to yield the breath.", "Of limbs enormous, but withal unsound,</br>Soft-swol'n and pale, here lay the Hydropsy;</br>Unwieldy man, with belly monstrous round</br>For ever fed with watery supply:</br>For still he drank, and yet he still was dry.</br>And here a moping Mystery did sit,</br>Mother of Spleen, in robes of various dye:</br>She call'd herself the Hypochonriac-Fit,</br>And frantic seem'd to some, to others seem'd a wit.", "A lady was she whimsical and proud,</br>Yet oft through fear her pride would crouchen low.</br>She felt or fancied, in her fluttering mood,</br>All the diseases that the Spittals know,</br>And sought all physic that the shops bestow;</br>And still new leaches and new drugs would try.</br>'Twas hard to hit her humour, high or low,</br>For sometimes she would laugh and sometimes cry,</br>Sometimes would waxen wroth; and all she knew not why.", "Fast by her side a listless virgin pin'd,</br>With aching head and squeamish heart-burnings;</br>Pale, bloated, cold, she seem'd to hate mankind,</br>But lov'd in secret all forbidden things.</br>And here the Tertian shook his chilling wings;</br>And here the Gout, half tiger, half a snake,</br>Rag'd with an hundred teeth, an hundred stings;</br>These and a thousand furies more did shake</br>These weary realms, and kept ease-loving men awake.</br>"]
