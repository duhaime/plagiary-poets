["But what most shew'd the vanity of life,</br>Was to behold the Nations all on fire,</br>In cruel broils engag'd, and deadly strife;</br>Most Christian Kings, inflam'd by black desire</br>With honourable ruffians in their hire,</br>Cause War to rage, and blood around to pour:</br>Of this sad work, when each begins to tire,</br>Then sit them down just where they were before</br>'Till for new scenes of woe, peace shall their force restore.</br>"]
