["If aught of Oaten Stop, or Pastoral Song,</br>May hope, O pensive Eve, to sooth thine Ear,</br>Like thy own brawling Springs,</br>Thy Springs, and dying Gales,</br>O Nymph reserv'd, while now the bright-hair'd Sun</br>Sits in yon western Tent, whose cloudy Skirts,</br>With Brede ethereal wove,</br>O'erhang his wavy Bed:</br>Now Air is hush'd, save where the weak-ey'd Bat,</br>With short shrill Shriek flits by on leathern Wing,</br>Or where the Beetle winds</br>His small but sullen Horn,</br>As oft he rises 'midst the twilight Path,</br>Against the Pilgrim born in heedless Hum:</br>Now teach me, Maid compos'd,</br>To breathe some soften'd Strain,</br>Whose Numbers stealing thro' thy darkning Vale,</br>May not unseemly with its Stillness suit;</br>As musing slow, I hail</br>Thy genial lov'd Return!</br>For when thy folding Star arising shews</br>His paly Circlet, at his warning Lamp</br>The fragrant Hours, and Elves</br>Who slept in Buds the Day,</br>And many a Nymph who wreathes her Brows with Sedge,</br>And sheds the fresh'ning Dew, and, lovelier still,</br>The Pensive Pleasures sweet,</br>Prepare thy shadowy Car.</br>Then let me rove some wild and heathy Scene,</br>Or find some Ruin 'midst its dreary Dells,</br>Whose Walls more awful nod</br>By thy religious Gleams.</br>Or if chill blustering Winds, or driving Rain,</br>Prevent my willing Feet, be mine the Hut,</br>That from the Mountain's Side</br>Views Wilds, and swelling Floods,</br>And Hamlets brown, and dim-discover'd Spires,</br>And hears their simple Bell, and marks o'er all</br>Thy Dewy Fingers draw</br>The gradual dusky Veil.</br>While Spring shall pour his Show'rs, as oft he wont,</br>And bathe thy breathing Tresses, meekest Eve!</br>While Summer loves to sport</br>Beneath thy ling'ring Light:</br>While sallow Autumn fills thy Lap with Leaves,</br>Or Winter yelling thro' the troublous Air,</br>Affrights thy shrinking Train,</br>And rudely rends thy Robes.</br>So long regardful of thy quiet Rule,</br>Shall Fancy, Friendship, Science, smiling Peace,</br>Thy gentlest Influence own,</br>And love thy fav'rite Name!</br>"]
