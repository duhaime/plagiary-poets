["Canst thou grow sad, thou say'st, as earth grows bright?</br>And sigh, when little birds begin discourse</br>In quick, low voices, ere the evening light</br>Pours on their nests, from out the day's fresh source?</br>With creatures innocent thou must perforce</br>A sharer be, if that thine heart be pure.</br>And holy hour like this, save sharp remorse,</br>Of ills and pains of life must be the cure,</br>And breathe in kindred calm, and teach thee to endure.</br>"]
