["Methought I saw in dead of silent night</br>A goodly Citie all to cinders turned,</br>Upon whose ruines sate a Nymphe in white,</br>Rending her haire of wiery gold, who mourned</br>Or for the fall of that faire Citie burned,</br>Or some deare Love, whose death so made her sad:</br>That since no joye in worldly thing she had.", "This was that GENIUS of that auntient TROY,</br>In her owne ashes buried long agoe;</br>So griev'd to see that BRITAINE should enjoy</br>Her PALLAS, whom she held and honour'd so:</br>And now no litle memorie could show</br>To eternize her, since she did infuse</br>Her Enthean soule, into his English Muse.</br>"]
