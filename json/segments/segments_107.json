["My beds are all furnish'd with fleas,</br>Whose bitings invite me to scratch;</br>Well stock'd are my orchards with jays,</br>And my pig-sties white over with thatch.</br>I seldom a pimple have met,</br>Such health does magnesia bestow;</br>My horse-pond is border'd with wet,</br>Where the flap-docks and sting-nettles grow.", "I have found out a gift for my fair,</br>In my Cheshire some rotten I've found;</br>But let me the plunder forbear,</br>Nor give that dear bosom a wound:</br>Though oft from her lips I have heard,</br>That the rotten her palate would please;</br>Yet he ne'er could be true, she averr'd,</br>Who would rob the poor mite of his cheese.", "And where does my Dorothy stray?</br>And where are her pattens and clogs?</br>As dirty as ours is the way;</br>In the country as fruitful in bogs?</br>The land may be fruitful in bogs,</br>And dirty may be all the ways;</br>The shepherds in manners like hogs,</br>For mine are the manners to please.</br>"]
