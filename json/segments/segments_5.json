["Marching in the plaine field of my conceyte,</br>I might behold a tent which was at rest,</br>My forces I did bend but ah deceite:</br>There left I freedome last which is now least.</br>For when I thought to fight with Mars for best,</br>There Cupid was which brought me to distresse,</br>Of foe when I thought to make a conquest,</br>Love and desire in tent did me oppresse.</br>These captaines twaine from tormet may surcease,</br>If they did know the lore I beare in minde,</br>They may as Turtles one procure thy ease,</br>O that to me of twaine one would be kinde.</br>Thou tent that holdst in night such turtle doves,</br>Rejoice, embrace the twayne of world the loves.</br>"]
