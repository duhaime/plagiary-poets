["Nature at length, as of existence tir'd,</br>Wakes from her slumber on the champaign drear,</br>And as sublime as e'er by bard admir'd,</br>Comes thron'd upon Tornado's dark career;</br>See Midnight, in the West, her banners rear;</br>The blood-red Sun looks troubled from the skies;</br>The distant thunder strikes the list'ning ear;</br>Joy fires again the once enthusiast's eyes,</br>As o'er Heav'n's wide expanse chaotic grandeurs rise.", "Still onward rolls the volum'd shroud of night,</br>More awfully in blazing face of day;</br>Far in its yawning bosom's dim twilight,</br>Ten thousand vast terrific eddies play:</br>Such has my fancy pictur'd in dismay,</br>The hour that brings the world's concluding doom:</br>Instand annihilation marks its way;</br>This moment smiles in light yon marble tomb,</br>And this 'tis wrapp'd from view in night's devouring gloom.</br>"]
