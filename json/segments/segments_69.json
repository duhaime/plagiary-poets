["When PEGGY, little slut, was young,</br>When, in her father's hut she sung,</br>The beaus delighted with the sound,</br>Every evening gathered round,</br>Romping, cuffing, hauling, mauling;</br>'Till once, 'tis said, when all was tir'd,</br>With brandy, gin-twist, sling, inspir'd,</br>They snatch'd, from all the neighb'ring hovels,</br>Fiddles, warming pans and shovels,</br>And as they oft had heard apart</br>Sweet lessons of their forceful art,</br>Each, for madness rul'd the hour,</br>Would prove his own inventive power.", "First JONATHAN, among the best,</br>His hand upon the fiddle laid:</br>But back recoil'd with all the rest,</br>To hear the discord he had made.</br>Next TOBY rush'd, a high strung blade,</br>But fill'd with Envy's secret stings:</br>'Twas thought so very hard he play'd,</br>He'd wear out fiddle-bow and strings.</br>With woeful phiz sat PELATIAH,</br>To him no leasing sound belongs,</br>He drew his chair towards the fire,</br>And now the shovel struck, and now the tongs.</br>But thou, O JOT!  with rudy nose,</br>What was thy delighted measure!</br>Still it whisper'd promis'd pleasure,</br>And bade the blooming girls the dance begin;</br>And when a fav'rite reel he choose,</br>A cry of \"keep it up!\" was heard at ev'ry close,</br>And JOT inclin'd his head, and gave a ghastly grin.</br>And longer had he play'd, but with a frown,</br>NATHAN impatient rose&mdash;</br>He threw his mighty fist in thunder down,</br>And, with a withering look,</br>A rusty fish-horn down he took,</br>And blew a blast, so loud and clear,</br>A second had prov'd fatal to the ear:&mdash;</br>And ever and anon he beat</br>An iron pot with furious heat;</br>And tho' sometimes each dreary pause between,</br>The little fifer at his knee,</br>Play'd \"dear, what can the matter be?\"</br>Yet still he drumm'd as tho' he meant</br>To rouze at least a regiment;</br>So great, so mighty an alarum</br>That had an army come 'twould scare'm.</br>The mind of ICABOD to nought was fix'd,</br>Alas!  how worried he must feel:</br>Of different times the veering tune was mix'd,</br>He now a hornpipe lov'd, now raving cri'd \"a reel!\"</br>Lo snugly in remotest corner,</br>With eyes uprais'd sat JEMMY HORNER,</br>Whose frequent jingling of a bell,</br>Tho' distant, yet was horrible,</br>Milk-pans, stew-pans, sauce-pans round,</br>Tin pots, tunnels join'd the sound:</br>Through porch and entry found its way,</br>And then in hollow murmurs died away,</br>&mdash;Then came JOB'S extatic trial,</br>But soon he shun'd the offer'd viol,</br>Tho' on the whole, he did'nt know,</br>But he could sing a psalm or so.</br>&mdash;Last of all see TOM advancing,</br>Now's the proper time for dancing.</br>The moment he began the tune</br>All was shuffle, rigadoon,</br>Fluttering back step, in the middle,</br>Turn your partner, mind the fiddle:&mdash;</br>\"KEEP IT UP!\"  was heard around,</br>\"KEEP IT UP!\"  the walls resound.</br>"]
