["When our first father thro' the dreary waste,</br>From Eden's plains an exile sad must go,</br>Oft he recall'd each scene of pleasure past,</br>Felt the dire change, and bid his sorrows flow.</br>Yet still a soft companion of his woe,</br>With sweet assiduous care attended near;</br>Fond to relieve, and resolute to shew</br>The soothing smile, or sympathyzing tear.</br>Far heavier doom, alas!  attends me here,</br>Who leave, of nymphs so fair, a train behind;</br>Nor one is found the tedious way to chear,</br>Or raise, with converse sweet, the drooping mind.</br>Then tell me, fair ones, can I chuse but grieve,</br>Who quit this Paradise, without an Eve.</br>"]
