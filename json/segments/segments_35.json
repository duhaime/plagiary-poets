["I.</br>Soft words, when flowing from a mouth so sweet,</br>How far do ye excel the deftest Air</br>That ever yet resounded from the seat,</br>Where the nine Maidens chant their Carols rare.</br>Thy Words alone, fair Nymph, so piercing are,</br>That through my simple heart they stricken be;</br>No Sounds may with their poignancy compare</br>To strike so deep, or wound so tenderly,</br>Ne Clio's Song, ne Phoebus choicest minstrelsy.", "II.</br>Why wish to sing?  sure that were covetise!</br>When as your Charms so forcibly persuade.</br>Small lack, I ween, have those dead-doing Eyes,</br>Of luring Song, or thrilling Music's Aid.</br>Leave that poor Art to him, who sore dismay'd,</br>Lest you receive his bold praise angrily,</br>Must strive, as Orpheus, Pluto's wrath allay'd,</br>To charm the threat'ning vengeance from your Eye,</br>And tune your soul to his, in kindred Harmony.</br>"]
