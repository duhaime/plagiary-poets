["Fair pearl-crown'd Nymph, whose gushing Torrent laves</br>This marble Rock with hollow-tinkling Waves;</br>Who wont'st in secret Solitude to dwell,</br>On Coral Beds beneath thy Sapphire Cell,</br>Whose Virgin-Pow'r can break the magic Charm,</br>Whose Look the black Enchanter's Hand disarm;</br>Whom Swains in neighb'ring Vales to sing delight,</br>Kind Guardian of their Flocks from blasting Sprite;</br>Permit me, Goddess, from thy silver Lake,</br>With cooling Draught my glowing Thirst to slake!</br>So, when thou bath'st, may no rude Satyr's Eye,</br>From some deep Brake thy naked Beauties spy:</br>May no chill Blast the ivied Oak invade,</br>That o'er thy Cavern waves his solemn Shade.</br>"]
