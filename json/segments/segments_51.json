["Harp of the South!  that never mouldering hung,</br>But daily by a Sylvan touch doth sing;</br>And hath thy numbers on soft zephyr flung,</br>'Till joyous listners did around thee cling,</br>Musing in ecstasy on ev'ry string:</br>Oh, happy harp!  ne'er let thine accents sleep!</br>Though pleas'd to hear the James a murmuring,</br>Still let thy sweeter sounds its silence keep,</br>And let a votarist smile, who'd frequent cause to weep.", "'Twas thus in ancient days of Caledon,</br>The lyre was foremost mid'st the happy croud;</br>When lay of mutual love, or glory won,</br>Arous'd the lover, or the warrior proud:</br>And each accordant theme was struck aloud.</br>Then to its strains sublime and high,</br>Fair maids and plumed chiefs enraptur'd bow'd,</br>Well pleas'd the burthen of the minstrelsy,</br>Was knighthood's dauntless deed, and beauty's matchless eye.", "Oh, strike once more!  and to thy happy hand,</br>Its magic numbers pleas'd obey;</br>Oh, strike once more!  and let thy skill command,</br>Those touching accents, of thy Halcyon lay;</br>Enchanting sweet, that ne'er may die away;</br>And always worthy of thy happy strain:</br>The, then my heart, enraptur'd at its sway,</br>Beats to a touch that ne'er was vain,</br>Then silent never be!  Enchantress!  strike again!</br>"]
