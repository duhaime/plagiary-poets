["Chloe's as cold as Ice, all Day,</br>And I still burn like Fire;</br>Why don't her Coldness melt away</br>Before my warm Desire?", "Or why is not my fervent Blaze</br>Check'd by her chilling Ice;</br>But I grow hotter, as I gaze,</br>The Flames much stronger rise.", "Strange!  that by Fire, which softens all,</br>More Hardness Ice should take,</br>And Ice, where-e'er it chance to fall,</br>A sudden Flame should make.", "But such is Love's prevailing Force,</br>In ev'ry gentle Mind;</br>It alters all whole Nature's Course,</br>And rules in ev'ry Kind.</br>"]
