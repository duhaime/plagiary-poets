["On a bench in the garrison room,</br>A poor pension'd Captain was laid,</br>And while he bewail'd his sad doom,</br>A knapsack supported his head.</br>The Lieutenants who heard him complain,</br>With a sigh to his sighs did replay;</br>And the Ensigns, who shar'd in his pain,</br>Stood mournfully murmuring by.", "What Folly, alas!  have I done,</br>(Thus sadly complaining he said),</br>To have chang'd my old trade for a gun,</br>'Twere better by far I had staid.</br>But I was ambitious and young,</br>And the name of a Captain seem'd great,</br>Nor did I repent it was done,</br>'Till now, when I find 'tis too late.", "\"How foolish was I to believe</br>The reduction would do me no wrong,</br>Or that I should have a reprieve,</br>Which the Colonel had flatter'd me long.</br>Poor I, who 'till now was so gay,</br>Must soon from my station remove,</br>Go cloath'd like a ploughman in grey,</br>Or live in a cottage on love.", "\"What tho' I have skill to complain,</br>Tho' the Muses my temples have crown'd,</br>And what tho' they hear my soft strain,</br>The Subs' all sit weeping around:</br>Ah, Captain, thy hopes are in vain,</br>Thy sash and thy gorget resign;</br>Thy spontoon thou must yield to a swain,</br>Whose regiment is older than thine.", "\"All ye, my companions so dear,</br>Who share in those hardships of mine,</br>Whatever you suffer, forbear,</br>Forbear at your fate to repine.</br>Our masters have sent us to range,</br>The wants of the state to supply,</br>'Twas their's to complete this great change,</br>And 'tis ours to be pension'd and die.", "\"If while my hard fate I sustain,</br>In their breasts any pity is found,</br>Let us be review'd once again,</br>Before I am laid in the ground.</br>The last humble boon that I crave,</br>Is to say, when they see the review,</br>(If they're pleas'd with the way we behave),</br>That they'll soon our commissions renew.\"</br>"]
