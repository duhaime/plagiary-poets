["Harp of the North!  that mouldering long hast hung</br>On the witch-elm that shades Saint Fillan's spring</br>And down the fitful breeze thy numbers flung</br>Till envious ivy did around thee cling,</br>Muffling with verdant ringlet every string,&mdash;</br>O minstrel harp, still must thine accents sleep?</br>'Mid rustling leaves and fountains murmuring,</br>Still must thy sweeter sounds their silence keep,</br>Nor bid a warrior smile, nor teach a maid to weep?", "Not thus, in ancient days of Caledon,</br>Was thy voice must amid the festal crowd,</br>When lay of hopeless love, or glory won,</br>Aroused the fearful, or subdued the proud.</br>At each according pause was heard aloud</br>Thine ardent symphony sublime and high!</br>Fair dames and crested chiefs attention bow'd;</br>For still the burden of thy minstrelsy</br>Was Knighthood's dauntless deed, and Beauty's matchless eye.", "O wake once more!  how rude soe'er the hand</br>That ventures o'er thy magic maze to stray;</br>O wake once more!  though scarce my skill command</br>Some feeble echoing of thine earlier lay:</br>Though harsh and faint, and soon to die away,</br>And all unworthy of thy nobler stain,</br>Yet if one heart throb higher at its sway,</br>The wizard note has not been touch'd in vain.</br>Then silent be no more!  Enchantress, wake again!</br>"]
