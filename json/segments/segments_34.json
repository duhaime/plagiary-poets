["Act 1 Scene 1:</br>A FOREST IN ARCADIA.</br>ENTER A SATYR.", "Shepherds fresh, and maidens fair,</br>Up, and taste the morning air.</br>See the day spring from afar</br>Beckons to the weary'd star,</br>Which all night his course hath run,</br>To rest him now his task is done.</br>See, already from the furrow</br>The shrill lark mounts, and bids good morrow</br>To the sun, that 'gins to peep</br>'Twixt the shoulders, slant and steep,</br>Of yonder mountains.  Up, for shame,</br>Sloth is shepherds greatest blame.</br>Now the time is to unfold,</br>While the dewy drops do hold</br>On the firm grass; for no rain</br>Will fall to-day on hill or plain,</br>Therefore will your flocks feed soon,</br>And rest them ere the sultry noon.", "Shepherds awake!  I hear the horn</br>Of PAN, beside the babbling bourn,</br>Sounding to the buskin'd chace,</br>Which of late our queen doth grace,</br>With many a fair nymph by her side:</br>I must hie away, and guide</br>Their nice steps through the thicket wide,</br>Lest they err: &mdash; So, swains, adieu!</br>Maidens chaste, and shepherds true,</br>All bliss alight on yours and you.</br>"]
