["Sweet Echo!  sportive Nymph, that dwell'st unseen</br>Within thy sound-encircled cave,</br>Or fleeting o'er the moon-light green,</br>Or where the baffled billows lave;</br>Some lonely time-disparted tower,</br>Oft at evening's pensive hour,</br>With loitering step I muse along,</br>Charm'd by the many-warbling song,</br>Whilst Silence o'er the sleeping vale</br>Fearfully spreads her gos'mer veil.</br>Now pleas'd I mark thy softer voice</br>Mimic the ruder torrent's noise,</br>List'ning 'mid the stilly scene,</br>By yond' willow-waving grove,</br>Oft, the trembling shades between,</br>In fancy's eye I see thee rove</br>\"Over the hills and far away,\"</br>Where the dapper elves do play,</br>Sounding sweet thy silver shell,</br>'Till near some hermit's moss-grown cell</br>(While 'mid the mazes of the wood</br>Thousand responsive notes on every side are heard),</br>Thou rests at length thy devious flight,</br>Smiling on the frowning Night,</br>Who, jealous of her drowsy sway,</br>Shuns the merry harbinger of day,</br>And seeks &mdash; tho' sadly loath to go&mdash;</br>Compell'd, the Stygian shades below.</br>"]
