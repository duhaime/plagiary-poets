["A Worthy Knight was Riding on the Plain,</br>In Armour Clad, which richly did Contain</br>The Gallant Marks of many Battels fought,</br>Tho' he before no Martial Habit sought;</br>How Warlike ere his Person seem'd to Sit</br>On a Bold Steed, that scarce obey'd the Bit:</br>Upon his Breast a Bloody Cross display'd,</br>The Precious drops for him his Saviour paid;</br>And on his Mighty Shield the same did bear,</br>To shew his Faith was made his Valours Care.</br>Yet with his Comely Looks appeared sad,</br>Without the sign of Fear or being bad;</br>Whom now a high Adventure did Command,</br>Which Great Gloriana, Queen of Fairy Land,</br>To Honour him, by her especial Grace,</br>Did on his Worth and trusty Merit place.</br>Like which his Soul no Earthly Glory deem'd,</br>If by her Virtuous might he esteem'd:</br>Wishing, each step his Courser made, to Try</br>His Prowess with the Stoutest Enemy.</br>Near to his side an Ass more white than Snow,</br>A Lovely Lady's weight did undergo;</br>Whose Form far whiter then the Beast she rid,</br>Under a Mournful Vail was fully hid,</br>Which shew'd the Secret Care in Heart she had;</br>And in a Line a Milk white Lamb she led.</br>Behind her did a Dwarfe at distance lad,</br>That wearied seem'd with bearing of her Bag:</br>Whilst in this Posture as they forward past,</br>The Day with Clouds was suddenly o'recast;</br>And pouring forth a horrid Storm of Rain,</br>To shelter did this Beauteous pair Constrain.</br>A shady Grove not far from them they spy'd,</br>Whose lofty Trees adorn'd with Summers Pride,</br>So broad did spread, that no Coelestial Light</br>Was there perceivable to Human Sight:</br>And all within were Paths and Alleys strange,</br>With Footing worn, and inward far did Range.</br>The Covert lik'd, with Pleasure they past on,</br>Joying to hear the Birds Harmonious Song;</br>Which, therein shelter'd, gratefully declare</br>By Songs their safety from Tempestuous Air;</br>Or seem'd in Notes to praise Trees straight and high,</br>The sayling Pine, or Cedar tall as Sky,</br>The Building Oak, and Elme the Love of Vines,</br>The Poplar least for want of Moisture Pines.</br>Whilst here in unknown Tracts their Persons stray,</br>Allur'd by pleasing steps till lost their way;</br>And when the blustring Storm was over blown,</br>Wandred to find the Path which first was known:</br>So many Intricacies and turnings seen,</br>As which to take or leave their doubt was then:</br>At last advanc'd, they forward did descrye</br>A Track that seem'd most beaten to the Eye;</br>Which tho' amidst this Labyrinth 'twas found,</br>They hop'd might lead to safe and open Ground:</br>Untill arriv'd unto a Caves deep sight,</br>When from his Steed this Hero did alight:</br>And fearless to his Dwarf commits the Care</br>Both of his Courser and his shining Spear.</br>Whose fair Companion soon him Caution gave,</br>As boldly he was moving toward this Cave;</br>Fearing that peril vainly he provok'd,</br>Or might find hidden fire before it smoak'd:</br>Adding whithal how her Soul boded then,</br>That wandring steps led them to Error's Den.</br>A Monster God and Man presum's to hate,</br>From which 'tis wisest timely to retreat:</br>Your worth preserv'd, as you Attempts restrain,</br>Where Men the Authors rashness may arraign.</br>These words thus say'd, her fearful Dwarf apace,</br>With Timorous looks sand voice bemon'd their Case:</br>Begging that Instant they'd for safety fly,</br>Since his Soul, tho' in his small Bulk, cou'd spy</br>Vast Mischiefs did within that Cave abscond,</br>And must, if fought, best Human Strength confound.</br>Whilst with a resolute Brow and hardy Flame,</br>The Youthful Knight unto this Dungeon came;</br>And looking in, his glistring Armour made</br>Some streaks of light within the dismal Shade;</br>By which he saw the ugly Monster lay'd,</br>Half way a Serpent horribly displayd:</br>Whose other Moyety did shape retain</br>Of Woman loathed, or fit for worst disdain:</br>And as she in her filthy Den did lye,</br>Prodigious Knots, with strange Deformity,</br>Her Monstrous form did variously surround;</br>Whilst for her Tail and deadly Sting the Ground</br>Too narrow seem'd, whose spurious Body bred</br>A thousand Monsters by her Dugs were fed.</br>And when that unquoth Light she had espy'd,</br>She Gap'd, that down her Throat her Brood might glide</br>Which done, this Monster leaves her Den, afraid,</br>And round her cursed Head her Tail displayd;</br>Tho' when she had perceiv'd this Champion bold,</br>She wou'd have turn'd unto her safer Hold:</br>Declining Light, as her most foul disgrace,</br>Whose False-hood fear'd Truth's plain and open Face</br>Which as this Hero saw, he forward went;</br>Fierce as a Lyon on his Prey is Bent:</br>And with his Brandish'd Sword the Monster stay'd,</br>At which enrag'd she yaun'd and lowdly bray'd:</br>Her deadly Sting and Tail 'gainst him advanc'd,</br>Whilst from her Head his strong blow downward glanc'd,</br>And passing thus her hardy sence amaz'd,</br>Till rage recruited, she more dreadful rais'd</br>Her ugly Bulk, and Circling it around</br>With her vast Stern, prodigiously from Ground,</br>A leap she took, and on his Shield did light,</br>When more his steady Temper to affright,</br>Her weight and various Form she round him cast,</br>That to stir Limb  his mighty Strength seem'd past.</br>Whose pittying Lady, as she did behold</br>This ugly Fiend like mighty Thongs enfold</br>The Comely Person of her Famous chief;</br>From Heaven she begg'd with Tears his soon relief:</br>Next urg'd him, howe'er suffring sad Constraint,</br>That in no force or vigour he should faint;</br>But choak the Fiend, ere she his Life should seize,</br>And from his Flesh his Soul with Torment squeeze.</br>Which Heroin speech his Heart to Fury wrought;</br>Who striving one Arm free'd, and with that caught</br>The Monster's Throat, by which enforc'd she spew'd</br>Prodigious Poison horribly Embru'd</br>With blackest Blood, and lumps of Gobbets raw;</br>Besides, Books, Paper, from her Cursed Maw</br>She then disgorg'd, with Frogs, Toads wanting Eyes,</br>Numerous as Spawns of Monsters that arise</br>From Slimy Nile, and with their stench much more</br>Afflicted him then all her Bodies power.</br>So nauceously by it his sence annoy'd,</br>As his fierce Courage seem'd more weak employ'd,</br>Which when the Serpent saw, her inward Sink</br>Discharged sholes of Creatures black as Ink</br>That round his Legs deform'dly soon did crawll,</br>Tho' in that Plight he felt no hurt at all.</br>Like to some Man whom sworms of Flyes infest,</br>And with their Buzzing noisy disturb his Rest;</br>Until his Hands do interrupt their Course,</br>Or they with weary'd Wings remove their Force.</br>Whilst thus enrag'd and conscious of worse shame,</br>With renew'd Fury to his Foe he came,</br>And striking her with more than human strength,</br>Her Head he sever'd from her Body's length:</br>Whence her Infernal Life flow'd from her Veins,</br>In Blood that fill'd the Ground with foulest stains.</br>Her scatter'd Brood, soon as their Parent fell,</br>Like Imps that nourish'd were by Food from Hell,</br>Deeply Lamenting did her Corps Surround,</br>Hoping they wonted entrance to have found.</br>But unattain'd, they in the Sanguine Flood</br>Wallowing, drank up their Mother's loathsom blood.</br>Which sight this gallant Person much amaz'd,</br>As he with horror on these Monsters gaz'd;</br>Whose glutted bodies swoll'n, asunder burst,</br>Kill'd by her Blood which them had kindly nurst</br>His Foes subdu'd, and by themselves thus slain,</br>T'wards him in haste his Lady mov'd again;</br>Saying, Lov'd Man, what Stars admir'd support</br>Cou'd human Prowess aid with such effort</br>As your Atchieves, whilst dead before you lies</br>The Fiend, with all her Brood of Enemies?</br>Worthy you are the Arms you wear to wield,</br>And prove 'em further in Some glorious Field;</br>Since in your first Adventures you compleat</br>Deeds that assure your future highly great.</br>Who mounted with his Lady back again,</br>Follow'd a Path which seem'd to them most plain,</br>And like a Line that straitest do's extend,</br>Led them unto this vast Wood's wish'd-for end!</br>Which pass'd, for new Adventures he prepar'd,</br>So great in Soul as nought but Heav'n he fear'd.</br>Far had he travell'd ere he did discern</br>The face of Man, or worldly Tidings learn;</br>When he an aged person met by chance,</br>That clad in black unto him did advance;</br>Whose Feet were bare, his Beard turn'd hoary gray,</br>Like Grass by Frost is chang'd on Winters day:</br>Lowly his Eyes unto the ground he bent,</br>And knock'd his Breast like Sinners that repent.</br>Who, when beheld this Chief, with comely Grace</br>And Looks, that suited well his aged Face,</br>Gravely salutes him; which no sooner done:</br>But this brave Champion ask'd, if to him known</br>Atchievements were, that farthest spread their fame</br>Or might, if sought, live great on Hero's name.</br>To whom the aged person thus reply'd,</br>What you require in course of Life's deny'd</br>To my observance, whilst most hours I tell</br>Within the Confines of an obscure Cell;</br>Where Beads I count, and whither loudest sound</br>Of warlike deeds, has yet least passage found.</br>But if of dangers you vouchsafe to hear,</br>That nearest home imploy the heedful ear:</br>Know that a mighty Man, of Fury strange,</br>Wasting this Country far and near doth range.</br>Vast distance hence in Wilderness most wilde</br>His Being is, where Beasts of prey more milde</br>Then him inhabit, whose Confines none pass,</br>But life must hazard, or their worse distress.</br>Of such a one I chiefly would enquire,</br>Reply'd this Knight, inflam'd with Martial Fire;</br>Judging that he the shame of Honour lives,</br>That unto Man unjust Oppression gives.</br>Which brave Resolve, when by his Heroin heard:</br>She said, Kind Sir, be yet a while deterr'd</br>Your forward Prowes, since your latest Fight</br>Requires your Toils should cease at least one Night:</br>When from untroubl'd Thought, and timely Rest,</br>You'll manage your ensuing Conduct best.</br>Thus Phoebus and his eager Steeds, some say,</br>Bait and refresh before next burning day.</br>Soon on these words the aged man took hold:</br>Saying, What Cavalier, of Deeds most bold,</br>Wou'd not to such a Beauteous Prudence yield,</br>That has espoused your Perils long in Field?</br>Wherefore take respite, as she does advice,</br>That with more force your Glory may arise.</br>Till when, with hers, let my perswasion joyn,</br>And rest with me in the small home is mine.</br>Which courteous offer did on them prevail,</br>And next he guides them to a pleasant Vale,</br>Where stood his Dwelling, far removed from Road,</br>Befitting well strict Hermits sole Abode.</br>A Chappel too there stood, near which did run</br>Streams that had from a sacred Fountain sprung.</br>Pleas'd they arriv'd, tho no Repast found here,</br>But Rest, more welcome than delicious fare.</br>Whilst with smooth words this seeming Hermit past</br>From Tale to Tale, so long as day did last:</br>Most touching Saints and Popes admir'd of old,</br>And kiss'd his Beads when of their deeds he told.</br>Soon had the Night their drowsy pow'rs inclin'd</br>To welcome Sleep, the Bodys ease and Mind:</br>Which seen, this old Deceiver gravely leads</br>Them unto Rooms, where they, instead of Beds,</br>On rushy Floors their weary Limbs repos'd,</br>And with fast Sleep their heavy Eye-lids clos'd.</br>Which when this man of cursed Arts did find,</br>He to a Cell retires, in which all kind</br>Of Magick Books and Spells he often us'd,</br>And cou'd raise Fiends that other Charms refus'd.</br>Where next, he hellish Poesy repeats,</br>That Heaven blasphem'd, and prais'd infernal States.</br>Proceeding thus, until the Stygian Frame</br>Shook, and awak'd black Pluto's Swarthy Dame:</br>From whom he summon'd Sprights in number more</br>Than Flies that swarm by Summers heatful power;</br>And these, like such, about his head did hum,</br>Waiting commands from his curs'd lips might come.</br>Of which two he two approv'd most swift cou'd fly</br>Through Airy Regions, and Invent worst Ly:</br>Whilst for his purpose he bids one to stay,</br>As t' other shou'd his far Commands obey:</br>Injoyning him with utmost speed to find</br>The Seat of Morpheus, where, with drouzy Mind,</br>He near unto smooth Thetis Bed doth rest</br>Clad in Night's blackest Mantle round his Breast.</br>Soon having past Oceans wide and deep,</br>This nimble Spirit found the God of Sleep,</br>Tho low repos'd in bosome of the Earth,</br>As seat of winds, or Zephirus moistest Birth;</br>Where trickling Streams from Rocks their passing find</br>And joyn their murmurs with the softest Wind.</br>Rudely he there the sleepy God had pusht,</br>And next from side to side his Body thrust;</br>Yet cou'd not so his heavy Sense awake,</br>Till noise he louder in his Ear did make,</br>Then sounds of Boreas on the Northern shore,</br>Where waves to clouds he lifts his rough power</br>At which the God, raising his lumpish head,</br>Frowning demanded, by whose Errant sped</br>He durst the sacred Residence molest</br>Of him allow'd the Deity of Rest?</br>To whom the Fiend reply'd, that him had sent</br>Contending Archimago, whose intent</br>Must be obey'd, before again he close</br>His drowzy eye lids, or his Soul repose.</br>And did require, that from his slumbring Sence,</br>The falsest Dream he shou'd by him dispence.</br>The easie God, unwilling to contend</br>With Magick Pow'r, delivers to this Fiend</br>A Dream that various Falthoods did contain,</br>And in his Cave till then had darkest layn:</br>Like which no Hellish Charms before obtain'd,</br>Or Poet with remotest Raptures feign'd.</br>Which done, the slumbring Morpheus void of care</br>Again repos'd, when mounting high in Air,</br>The Fiend arriv'd to his enchanting Lord,</br>Whose wicked Brain did variously afford</br>Deep Magick Arts, and, e're return'd this Spright,</br>Of th' other form'd a Beauty to the sight:</br>Her tender parts compos'd of liquid Air,</br>And for more wonder seem'd like Una fair.</br>In Dress and comely Meen resembl'd so,</br>As Twin to twin did ne're such likeness show.</br>The Spright that with the evil Dream arriv'd,</br>With this Fictitious Beauty soon contriv'd</br>How the bold Cavalier, that sleeping lay,</br>They might to her alluring Form betray.</br>To perfect which, with well instructed haste,</br>Next to his slumbring head the Fiend was plac'd</br>The Dream had brought, and by its Charms instilld</br>Thoughts that the Hero's sleep with Lust had fill'd;</br>Whose resolute heart began to melt away,</br>As he conceiv'd his Lady by him lay;</br>And with her loosest Grace did him invite</br>To foul Desire, and wanton Love's delight:</br>And tho the Daughter of a mighty King,</br>Stain'd with the blackest guilt that Lust could bring.</br>Whom he before allow'd the chastest Flower,</br>That e're was beautify'd by Natures Power:</br>Whilst these sad Passions did his Soul affright;</br>Songs, soft as Hymen's, gave his Ear delight:</br>To which to Goddess Flora seem'd to dance</br>With gayest Nymphs, that welcom Springs advance,</br>Then up he starts, when with amazed Eye</br>He saw the beauteous Tempter next him lye,</br>Offr'ing to kiss him with a blushing Grace,</br>To liken more fair Una's modest Face.</br>Wounded in Soul at this distastful Shame,</br>He thought to kill her Body's lustful Frame.</br>And as he thus resolv'd, with softest Grief</br>And Tears constrain'd, she courts her Love's relief;</br>Saying, What Woman's Breast can quench that fire,</br>Which Stars and Love resistless do conspire?</br>Who I acknowledge, from my wretched State,</br>Death due to me, or what is worse, your Hate:</br>Yet pity well my youthful Love's Effort,</br>And how for you I left my Father's Court,</br>To wander far as Fortune you should call;</br>At which she stopt, whilst Tears did from her fall.</br>Then speaks and sighs, and weeps as much again,</br>So like to Grief, as none she seem'd to feign:</br>To which her Lover with Resentment said,</br>What makes your Virtue, Madam, now dismay'd,</br>That lately me incourag'd not to fear</br>When worst of Monsters did my Foes appear?</br>Love of your self, said she, and dear Constraint,</br>Forc'd my Address, to you, and sad Complaint;</br>Who cou'd this tedious Night find no Repose,</br>Longing in your embrace my Eyes to close;</br>Whilst you imploy in careless sleep your Time,</br>That least should nourish Lovers slothful Crime.</br>What fascination e're like this did move</br>The Soul of youthful Man inflam'd by Love?</br>Yet since in her no actual Ill he knew,</br>He wou'd not rashly censure her untrue;</br>But with advis'd deliberation saies.</br>If Love to me your softer Passion sways,</br>'Tis Una still in your bright Form I fee,</br>To whom no Genius bad can liken'd be.</br>Let not then vain Distrust procure your smart</br>But to your Rest this gloomy Night depart.</br>At which, with Grief conceal'd, the Fiend declin'd</br>Further Attempts against his stedfast mind;</br>Seeming to yield her false Desires appeas'd,</br>Since 'twas his will by words she should be pleas'd:</br>And moving from him with a feigned Grace,</br>Withdrew, as if she'd find her resting Place.</br>Long had he ponder'd the uneasie thought</br>Of her Address, resembling Woman nought;</br>For whose defence his life he wou'd expose:</br>Lying thus perplexed till sleep his Eyes did close.</br>Prone unto ease, o're-toil'd with former Fight,</br>Yet cou'd not rest for Dreams of frail Delight:</br>That seem'd to tantalize his drowzy Powers,</br>With sights of Beauties lying in Beds and Bowers:</br>And when all these had vanish'd from his Brain,</br>He thought the former Fiend he found again,</br>"]
