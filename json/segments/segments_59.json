["Lo, too, in sight, the youth of Severn's side!</br>His name who knows not?  in yon dusky vale</br>Stalks lonely; striving, but in vain, to hide</br>His woes in darkness, whilst he tells the gale</br>That whistles round a melancholy tale:</br>Him Hope refused her ever-cheering face:</br>On frenzy's tide was rent his shatter'd sail;</br>What wonder then, on life's disgusting race,</br>If, recreant in the course, he sickening stopp'd his pace.", "Lord of some talent, and in these dull days,</br>When not to wholly fail is to succeed,</br>Th' awakening Muse with no ignoble bays,</br>Harold, hath deck'd thy brow; Parnassian meed</br>Not undeserved!  But of that master breed</br>Thou wouldst be thought, those souls who sway mankind;</br>Not thine, in sooth, nor sprung from such a seed!</br>But where caprice or passion lent the wind,</br>Veered round to every point that weathercock thy mind.</br>"]
