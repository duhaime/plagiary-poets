["Ye shepherds that dwell on the plains</br>Attend to a swain in despair,</br>Attend to my mournful love strains,</br>Fair Phyllis is false, I declare.", "No longer she hears my love tale,</br>Nor lists to my pastoral song,</br>She dances with Will of the dale,</br>How sweetly she trips it along!", "Reclin'd on the banks of a stream,</br>Our flocks feeding carelessly by,</br>With Phyllis, when love was the theme,</br>How chearful and happy was I.", "No more will I join the gay throng,</br>That merrily dance on the plain,</br>Adieu!  my lov'd pastoral song,</br>Of Phyllis I'll never complain.</br>"]
