["Daughter of Plutus!  spangled power!</br>Thou ruler of the female breast,</br>Whose glittering domes at midnight hour,</br>The belles do throng, the beaux infest!</br>Bound in thy folly-woven chain,</br>The Proud are taught to be more vain;</br>And female sparklers inly groan,</br>If they abide not in dress, admired, and alone.", "When Venus, first to send on earth</br>Beauty, her lovely child, design'd;</br>To thee she gave the heavenly birth,</br>And bade to form her infant mind.</br>Card-loving muse!  thy mystic lore</br>With patience fifteen years she bore;</br>The toilet's art thou bad'st her know;</br>From her own skill she learn'd her glowing form to show.", "Lur'd to thy willing arms, they fly,</br>Self pleasing folly's idle brood,</br>Laughter, and noise, and thoughtless joy,</br>That leave no leisure to be good.</br>Quick they attend, and with them go</br>The proud coquette, the flatt'ring beau;</br>By thy complying throng receiv'd,</br>To each they vow their love, and are by none believ'd.", "O, gently on thy suppliant's head,</br>Bright goddess, lay thy ring-deck'd hand;</br>Not in thy Persian glories clad,</br>Nor circled by the jewel'd band,</br>As by thy votaries thou art seen,</br>With lisping voice, and lanquid mein;</br>With quaver'd music's tuneful cry,</br>Scandal and lies, slander, and pompous vanity!", "Folly, in motley garb array'd,</br>With ideot smile, and vacant stare;</br>And dissipation, listless maid,</br>With languid eye, that loves thy glare,</br>Still on thy mincing steps attend</br>And flattery, the would-be friend;</br>Self love, who holds himself so dear;</br>False pity, dropping soft the hypocritick tear!", "Thy form benign, O Goddess, wear;</br>Thy milder influence impart!</br>Let friendship's sacred train be there,</br>To soften, and inspire the heart;</br>And playful mirth, and fancy wild,</br>Benevolence, and wisdom mild,</br>Good nature others' faults to scan,</br>Thus may I ever live, and prove myself a man!</br>"]
