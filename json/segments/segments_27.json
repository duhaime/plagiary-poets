["Daughter of JOVE, relentless Power,</br>Thou Tamer of the human breast,</br>Whose iron scourge and tort'ring hour</br>The Bad affright, afflict the Best!</br>Bound in thy adamantine chain</br>The Proud are taught to taste of pain,</br>And purple Tyrants vainly groan</br>With pangs unfelt before, unpitied and alone.", "When first thy Sire to send on earth</br>Virtue, his darling Child, design'd,</br>To thee he gave the heav'nly Birth,</br>And bad to form her infant mind.</br>Stern rugged Nurse!  thy rigid lore</br>With patience many a year she bore:</br>What sorrow was, thou bad'st her know,</br>And from her own she learn'd to melt at other's woe.", "Scared at thy frown terrific, fly</br>Self-pleasing Folly's idle brood,</br>Wild Laughter, Noise, and thoughtless Joy,</br>And leave us leisure to be good.</br>Light they disperse, and with them go</br>The summer Friend, the flatt'ring Foe;</br>By vain Prosperity received,</br>To her they vow their truth, and are again believed.", "Wisdom in sable garb array'd</br>Immers'd in rapt'rous thought profound,</br>And Melancholy, silent maid</br>With leaden eye, that loves the ground,</br>Still on thy solemn steps attend:</br>Warm Charity, the gen'ral friend,</br>With Justice to herself severe,</br>And Pity, dropping soft the sadly-pleasing tear.", "Oh, gently on thy Suppliant's head,</br>Dread Goddess, lay thy chast'ning hand!</br>Not in thy Gorgon terrors clad,</br>Nor circled with the vengeful Band</br>(As by the Impious thou art seen)</br>With thund'ring voice, and threat'ning mien,</br>With screaming Horror's funeral cry,</br>Despair, and fell Disease, and ghastly Poverty.", "Thy form benign, oh Goddess, wear,</br>Thy milder influence impart,</br>Thy philosophic Train be there</br>To soften, not to wound my heart,</br>The gen'rous spark extinct revive,</br>Teach me to love and to forgive,</br>Exact my own defects to scan,</br>What others are, to feel, and know myself a Man.</br>"]
