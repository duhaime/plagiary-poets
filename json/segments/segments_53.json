["Hence, loath'd vulgarity,</br>Of ignorance and native dullness bred,</br>In low unwholesome shed,</br>'Mongst thieves and drabs, and street-sweeps asking charity:</br>Find some suburban haunt,</br>Where the spruce 'prentice treats his flashy mate,</br>And smoking cits debate:</br>Or at a dowdy rout, or ticket-ball,</br>Giv'n at Freemason's hall,</br>With tawdry clothes and liveries ever flaunt.</br>But come, thou nymph of slender waist,</br>Known early by the name of Taste,</br>And now denominated Fashion,</br>Whom erst, by no unlawful passion,</br>Pleasure's fair nymph, on Britain's shore,</br>To radiant-ey'd Apollo bore:</br>Or Hermes, (so the grave dispute is)</br>The frolic god of chemist beauties,</br>Found Lady &mdash; &mdash; in the dark,</br>As once they met at &mdash; &mdash; Park,</br>There, on a couch of damask blue,</br>And squabs, and cushions, damask too,</br>Fill'd her with thee, thou white-arm'd fair,</br>So delicate and de bon air.</br>Haste thee, nymph, and bring with thee</br>Steed, and light-hung Tilbury,</br>Undiscoverable rouge,</br>Polish'd boots, and neckcloth huge,</br>(Such as might deck a Dandy's cheek,</br>And draw the gazers for a week.)</br>M-ck-nt-sh's racy phrase,</br>And wit, that peerless W-rd might praise.</br>Come, and let your steps be bent</br>With a lively measurement,</br>And bring the proper airs and graces,</br>That make their way in certain places:</br>And, if I give thee honour due,</br>Fashion, enroll me with the few,</br>With Sp-nc-r, S-dn-y Sm-th, and thee,</br>In a select society:</br>To ride when many a lade fair, in</br>Her morning veil begins her airing,</br>And with the nurse and children stow'd,</br>Drives down the Park, or Chelsea road:</br>Then to stop in spite of sorrow,</br>And through the window bid good morrow</br>Of vis-a-vis, or barouchette,</br>Or half-open landaulet:</br>While little B-rke, with lively din,</br>Scatters his stock of trifles thin,</br>And at the Bridge, or Grosvenor Gate,</br>Briskly bids his horses wait;</br>Oft listening how the Catalini</br>Rouses at night th' applauding many,</br>In some opera of Mozart,</br>Winning the eye, the ear, the heart,</br>Then in the round-room not unseen,</br>Attending the dames of noble mien,</br>Right to the door in Market-lane,</br>Where chairmen range their jostling train,</br>And footmen stand with torch alight,</br>In their thousand liveries dight,</br>While the doorkeeper on the stairs,</br>Bawls for the Marchionesses' chairs,</br>And young dragoons enjoy the crowd,</br>And dowagers inveigh aloud,</br>And lovers write a hasty scrawl,</br>Upon the ticket of a shawl.</br>Straight mine eye hath caught new pleasures,</br>As the circling crowd it measures;</br>Virgins old with tresses gray,</br>That in corkscrew curls do stray;</br>Ladies, on whose softer breast,</br>Gallants receive a hope of rest;</br>Little feet with sandals tied,</br>Shallow heads and shoulders wide;</br>Necks and throats of lovely form,</br>Bosom'd high in tippet warm,</br>Where some beauty spreads her snare,</br>The envy of surrounding fair.</br>Hard by, the Op'ra being past,</br>To some small supper let me haste,</br>Where ladies, wits, and poets met,</br>Are at their various banquet set,</br>Of fifty little tempting messes,</br>Which the neat-handed Gunter dresses:</br>And there with satisfaction see</br>The pullet and the early pea,</br>Or, if the sultry dog-star reign,</br>The melon ice and cool champagne.</br>Sometimes, to a late delight</br>Argyll advertisements invite,</br>Where the wreathed waltz goes round,</br>Or English tunes more briskly sound,</br>To twice a hundred feet or more,</br>Dancing on the chalky floor:</br>And wise mama, well pleased to see</br>Her daughter paired with high degree,</br>Stays till the daylight glares amain:</br>Then in the carriage home again,</br>With stories told, of many a bow,</br>And civil speech from so and so.</br>She was ask'd to dance, she said,</br>But scarcely down the middle led,</br>Because his Lordship only thought,</br>How soonest to find out a spot,</br>Where, seated by her side, unheard,</br>He whisper'd many a pretty word,</br>Such as no poet could excel!</br>Then, having paid his court so well,</br>Most manifestly meaning marriage,</br>He fetch'd the shawls and call'd the carriage,</br>Handed her from the crowded door,</br>And watch'd till she was seen no more.</br>Thus done the tales, the flutt'ring fair</br>Go up to bed, and curl their hair.</br>Country houses please me too,</br>And the jocund Christmas crew,</br>Where chiefs of adverse politics</br>Awhile in social circle mix,</br>And tenants come, whose country franchise</br>Connects them with the higher branches,</br>Since all the great alike contend</br>For votes, on which they all depend.</br>Let affability be there,</br>With cordial hand and friendly air,</br>And private play and glittering fete,</br>To make the rustic gentry prate,&mdash;</br>Such joys as fill young ladies heads,</br>Who judge from books of masquerades.</br>Then will I to St. Stephens stray,</br>If aught be moved by C-stl-r-gh,</br>Or matchless C-nn-g mean to roll,</br>His thunders o'er the subject soul.</br>And sometimes, to divert my cares,</br>Give me some flirt, with joyous airs,</br>Married a girl, a widow now,</br>Such as will hear each playful vow,</br>Too young to lay upon the shelf:</br>Meaning &mdash; as little as myself:&mdash;</br>Still speaking, singing, walking, running,</br>With wanton heed and giddy cunning,</br>With a good mien to testify</br>Her converse with good company,</br>That Chesterfield might lift his eyes</br>From the dark Tartarus where he lies,</br>Beholding, in her air and gait,</br>Graces that almost compensate</br>The blunders of his awkward son,</br>And half the harm his book has done.</br>These delights if thou canst give,</br>Fashion, with thee I wish to live.</br>"]
