["Hence, loathed Melancholy,</br>Of Cerberus and blackest Midnight born,</br>In Stygian cave forlorn,</br>'Mongst horrid shapes, and shrieks, and sights unholy!</br>Find out some uncouth cell,</br>Where brooding Darkness sprends his jealous wings,</br>And the night-raven sings;</br>There under ebon shades, and low-brow'd rocks,</br>As ragged as thy locks,</br>In dark Cimmerian desert ever dwell.</br>But come, thou goddess fair and free,</br>In Heaven yclep'd Euphrosyne,</br>And by Men, heart-easing Mirth;</br>Whom lovely Venus, at a birth,</br>With two sister Graces more,</br>To ivy-crowned Bacchus bore:</br>Or whether (as some sager sing)</br>The frolick wind, that breathes the spring,</br>Zephyr, with Aurora playing,</br>As he met her once a-Maying;</br>There on beds of violets blue,</br>And fresh-blown roses wash'd in dew,</br>Fill'd her with thee a daughter fair,</br>So buxom, blithe, and debonair.", "Haste thee, Nymph, and bring with thee</br>Jest, and youthful Jollity,</br>Quips, and Cranks, and wanton Wiles,</br>Nods, and Becks, and wreathed Smiles,</br>Such as hang on Hebe's cheek,</br>And love to live in dimple sleek;</br>Sport that wrinkled Care derides,</br>And Laughter holding both his sides.</br>Come, and trip it, as you go,</br>On the light fantastick toe;</br>And in thy right hand lead with thee</br>The mountain-nymph, sweet Liberty;</br>And, if I give the honour due,</br>Mirth, admit me of thy crew,</br>To live with her, and live with thee,</br>In unreproved pleasures free;</br>To hear the lark begin his flight,</br>And singing startle the dull night,</br>From his watch-tower in the skies,</br>Till the dappled dawn doth rise;</br>Then to come, in spite of sorrow,</br>And at my window bid good morrow,</br>Through the sweet-briar, or the vine,</br>Or the twisted eglantine:</br>While the cock, with lively din,</br>Scatters the rear of Darkness thin;</br>And to the stack, or the barn-door,</br>Stoutly struts his dames before:</br>Oft listening how the hounds and horn</br>Cheerly rouse the slumbering morn,</br>From the side of some hoar hill,</br>Through the high wood echoing shrill:</br>Some time walking, not unseen,</br>By hedge-row elms, on hillocks green,</br>Right against the eastern gate</br>Where the great sun begins his state,</br>Robed in flames, and amber light,</br>The clouds in thousand liveries dight;</br>While the plowman, near at hand,</br>Whistles o'er the furrow'd land,</br>And the milkmaid singeth blithe,</br>And the mower whets his sithe,</br>And every shepherd tells his tale</br>Under the hawthorn in the dale.</br>Straight mine eye hath caught new pleasures,</br>Whilst the landskip round it measures;</br>Russet lawns, and fallows gray,</br>Where the nibbling flocks do stray;</br>Mountains, on whose barren breast</br>The labouring clouds do often rest;</br>Meadows trim with daisies pide,</br>Shallow brooks, and rivers wide:</br>Towers and battlements it sees</br>Bosom'd high in tufted trees,</br>Where perhaps some Beauty lies,</br>The Cynosure of neighbouring eyes.</br>Hard by, a cottage chimney smoaks,</br>From betwixt two aged oaks,</br>Where Corydon and Thyrsis, met,</br>Are at their savoury dinner set</br>Of herbs, and other country messes,</br>Which the neat-handed Phillis dresses;</br>And then in haste the bower she leaves,</br>With Thestylis to bind the sheaves;</br>Or, if the earlier season lead,</br>To the tann'd haycock in the mead,</br>Sometimes with secure delight</br>The upland hamlets will invite,</br>When the merry bells ring round,</br>And the jocund rebecks sound</br>To many a youth, and many a maid,</br>Dancing in the chequer'd shade;</br>And young and old come forth to play</br>On a sun-shine holy-day,</br>Till the live-long day-light fail</br>Then to the spicy nut-brown ale,</br>With stories told of many a feat,</br>How faery Mab the junkets eat;</br>She was pinch'd, and pull'd, she sed;</br>And he, by friars lantern led,</br>Tells how the drudging Goblin swet,</br>To earn his cream-bowl duly set,</br>When in one night, ere glimpse of morn,</br>His shadowy flail hath thresh'd the corn,</br>That ten days labourers could not end;</br>Then lies him down the lubber fiend,</br>And, stretch'd out all the chimney's length,</br>Basks at the fire his hairy strength;</br>And crop-full out of doors he flings,</br>Ere the first cock his matin rings.</br>Thus done the tales, to bed they creep,</br>By whispering winds soon lull'd asleep.</br>Tower'd cities please us then,</br>And the busy hum of men,</br>Where throngs of knights and barons bold,</br>In weeds of peace, high triumphs hold,</br>With store of ladies, whose bright eyes</br>Rain influence, and judge the prize</br>Of wit, or arms, while both contend</br>To win her grace, whom all commend.</br>There let Hymen oft appear</br>In saffron robe, with taper clear,</br>And pomp, and feast, and revelry,</br>With mask, and antique pageantry;</br>Such sights as youthful poets dream</br>On summer eves by haunted stream.</br>Then to the well-trod stage anon,</br>If Jonson's learned sock be on,</br>Or sweetest Shakspeare, Fancy's child,</br>Warble his native wood-notes wild.</br>And ever, against eating cares,</br>Lap me in soft Lydian airs,</br>Married to immortal verse;</br>Such as the meeting soul may pierce,</br>In notes, with many a winding bout</br>Of linked sweetness long drawn out,</br>With wanton heed and giddy cunning;</br>The melting voice through mazes running,</br>Untwisting all the chains that tie</br>The hidden soul of harmony;</br>That Orpheus' self may heave his head</br>From golden slumber on a bed</br>Of heap'd Elysian flowers, and hear</br>Such strains as would have won the ear</br>Of Pluto, to have quite set free</br>His half-regain'd Eurydice.", "These delights if thou canst give,</br>Mirth, with thee I mean to live.</br>"]
