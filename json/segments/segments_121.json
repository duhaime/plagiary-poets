["If ever you listen'd to love,</br>Ah!  Phillis, but hear me complain,</br>The stream that flows by, and the grove,</br>Can witness the truth of my pain.", "Reclin'd on the bank I have laid,</br>The stream glided softly along,</br>My pipe turn'd to love, I have play'd</br>The hills have re-echo'd my song.", "But seeing no nymph on the plain,</br>My pipe I threw by on the ground,</br>Would Phillis attend to my strain,</br>My pipe should for ever resound.", "Ah!  Phillis, more bright than the day,</br>More innocent far than the dove,</br>Thy words such a sweetness convey,</br>I could listen for ever and love.", "The sheep that graze over my plain,</br>With Corydon's flock cannot vie;</br>You may find out a far richer swain,</br>But none that can love you like I.", "Beware of fond Corydon's art,</br>When he flatters or warbles his song,</br>Sincerity dwells in the heart,</br>And flows from its source to the tongue.", "With softness he'll murmur his tale,</br>\"How the rose with your charms cannot vie,</br>The lilies with envy turn pale,</br>Repine at your triumphs and die.\"", "Let him flatter, and point out his pain,</br>If Phillis ne'er lends him an ear;</br>But should she attend to his strain,</br>Alas!  I should die with despair.", "Ah!  Phillis, return then my love,</br>With a smile but attend to my tale,</br>My pipe should resound thro' the grove,</br>And tell all its joy to the vale.", "Oh!  could I be bless'd with thy charms,</br>'Tis all my fond wishes require;</br>One moment reclin'd in thine arms,</br>Enraptur'd I'd smile and expire.</br>"]
