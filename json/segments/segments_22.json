["One nymph there was, methought, in bloom of May,</br>On whom the idle Fiend glanced many a look,</br>In hopes to lead her down the slippery way</br>To taste of Pleasure's deep-deceitful brook:</br>No virtues yet her gentle mind forsook;</br>No idle whims, no vapours fill'd her brain;</br>But Prudence for her youthful guide she took,</br>And Goodness, which no earthly vice could stain,</br>Dwelt in her mind; she was ne proud, I ween, or vain.</br>"]
