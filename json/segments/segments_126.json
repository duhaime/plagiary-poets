["The curfew tolls the knell of parting day,</br>The post-boy gallops briskly o'er the lea,</br>The pressman homeward plods his weary way,</br>And leaves his place to darkness, and to me.", "Now fades the glimmering twilight on the sight,</br>And all the room a solemn stillness holds,</br>Save where the wasp hums from the ceiling's height,</br>And crickets chirrup from their distant holes;", "Save that from yonder nest, beneath the floor,</br>The nibbling mouse does all alone complain</br>That she, amid her hard-earned, scanty store,</br>Can find, for all her labour, little gain.", "Beneath those rugged stands, that galley's shade,</br>Where lies the dust in many a little heap,</br>Each in its narrow cell neglected laid,</br>The old progenitors of libels sleep.", "The brawling speech from demagogue forlorn,</br>The poet spinning verses from his head,</br>The news-man's \"bloody news,\" the post-boy's horn,</br>No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed.", "For them no more the midnight lamp shall burn,</br>Or busy scribbler ply his evening care;</br>No devils run to wait the proof's return,</br>Nor dance attendance round an author's chair.", "Oft did Delusion to their prowess yield;</br>Their labours oft the shield of vice have broke;</br>In mighty columns, how they took the field!</br>How bow'd the knave beneath their sturdy stroke!", "Let not ambition mock their useful toil,</br>Their humble works, and destiny obscure;</br>Nor grandeur hear with a disdainful smile,</br>The short and simple annals of the poor.</br>"]
