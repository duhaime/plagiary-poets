["'Twas on the civic feast to be held soon,</br>Thought warlike Wellington:</br>Aloft in awful state,</br>The godlike hero sat,</br>On his imperial throne.</br>His sapient peers were placed around,</br>Their brows with foolscap paper bound,</br>So should such ministers be crown'd:</br>The map of London, by his side,</br>Lay &mdash; like a duteous eastern bride&mdash;</br>In anxious hope and slavery's pride.</br>Noble, noble, noble school?</br>None but the brave,</br>None but the brave,</br>None but the brave deserve to rule.", "Self-flatt'ry soar'd on high</br>Above the council board,</br>And whisper'd to the mighty lord,</br>Its trembling notes around him fly</br>And heavenly dreams afford.</br>The dream began from when</br>He took a seat above statesmen&mdash;</br>Such is the power the mighty love;</br>Sublime o'er common sense he rode,</br>When he to fair Britannia prest,</br>And when he sought her free-born breast,</br>Then far all competition hurl'd,</br>And made a statesman of himself, a sovereign of the world.</br>The listening house admire the talents found;</br>A present deity they shout around;</br>A present deity the vaulted roofs rebound?</br>With ravish'd ears</br>The warrior hears,</br>Assumes the god,</br>Affects to nod,</br>And seems to shake the spheres.", "The praise of Beer-halls then the sweet deceiver sang,</br>Of Beer-halls that from the last session sprang,</br>The jolly bill in triumph comes,</br>Sound the trumpets, beat the drums;</br>Flush'd with a ruddy grace</br>It shows its honest face:</br>Now give the hautboys breath; it comes, it comes.</br>Beer-bills' blessings are a treasure,</br>Drinking is the soldier's pleasure;</br>Rich the treasure,</br>Sweet the pleasure,</br>Sweet the pleasure after pain.", "Sooth'd with the thought the Duke grew vain,</br>Fought all his battles o'er again,</br>And thrice he routed all his foes, and thrice he slew the slain.</br>Self-flatt'ry saw the madness rise,</br>His glowing cheeks, his ardent eyes,</br>And, while he heaven and earth defied,</br>Chang'd the theme, and check'd his pride.</br>It chose a mournful muse,</br>Soft pity to infuse;</br>It sang Napoleon's overthrown</br>By too severe a fate,</br>Fallen, fallen, fallen, fallen,</br>Fallen from his high estate,</br>And boastful from his throne.</br>Deserted at his utmost need</br>By those his former bounty fed;</br>On the far rock confin'd he lies,</br>With not a friend to close his eyes.</br>With unmov'd looks the hardy victor sat,</br>Revolving in his steady soul</br>The various turns of weal and woe,</br>On the wide map below.", "The mighty spirit smil'd to see</br>Feasting was in the next degree,</br>'Twas but a kindred thought to wake,</br>For the map led to a beef-steak.</br>Softly sweet in Lydian measures,</br>Soon he sooth'd his soul to pleasures:</br>War, he sang, was toil and trouble,</br>Honour but an empty bubble;</br>Never ending, still beginning,</br>Fighting still, and still destroying;</br>If the world be worth the winning,</br>Think, oh!  think it worth enjoying.</br>A civic feast is spread beside thee,</br>Take the goods the gods provide thee;</br>The many'll rend the skies with loud applause,</br>And thy police uphold the threatened laws.</br>The Duke, unable to conceal his pain,</br>Gazed on the map</br>In dread of a mishap,</br>And thought and looked, thought and looked,</br>Thought and looked, and looked again.</br>At length with hope and confidence imprest,</br>The heroic statesman planned the civic feast.", "But hark!  to that redoubted knock,</br>A louder still, and still a louder shock;</br>Break his flattering dream asunder,</br>And rouse him like a ranting peal of thunder.</br>Hark!  hark!  the horrid sound</br>Has raised up his head;</br>As awaked from the dead,</br>And amazed, he stares around.</br>A letter, a letter, the postman cries&mdash;</br>See the rabble arise;</br>See the mob how they rear;</br>How they hiss in their lair,</br>And the sparkles that flash from their eyes.</br>Behold a ghastly band,</br>How they traverse the Strand:</br>Those are Freedom's ghosts, that in slumber have lain,</br>And in false hopes remain,</br>Trusting to the new reign.</br>Give the vengeance due</br>To the Radical crew:</br>Behold, how they point to the civic abode;</br>They will slay at its door the warrior lord.</br>The Home Sec. read the scroll with a terrified glow,</br>And the King was persuaded the feast to forego.</br>The Duke led the way</br>To the House the next day,</br>And read a kind letter from Alderman Kay.", "Thus long ago,</br>Ere letters could the world o'erthrow,</br>While aldermen were mute,</br>Self-flattery had caused to shoot,</br>Above the soldier's fire,</br>The thought that he could awe and govern an Empire.</br>At last the fearful letter came</br>To check the heroic statesman's flame.</br>The gentle letter, by its mystic lore,</br>Replaced the former narrow bounds,</br>And softly breathed those solemn sounds&mdash;</br>Back to thy mother wit, from arts unknown before.</br>Let old self-flattery yield the prize,</br>Or Kay divide the crown;</br>It bid a misled hero rise,</br>He pulled a hero down.</br>"]
