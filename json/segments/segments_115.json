["Ye spacious rooms, ye folding doors,</br>Eternal foes to rest,</br>Where grateful pleasure still adores</br>Her Almack's much lov'd taste;</br>Ah!  happy mansions, sweet resorts</br>Of Britain's matchless fair,</br>Where many a thoughtless miss disports</br>A stranger yet to care;</br>I feel the gales that from ye come</br>Afford a soft and sweet perfume:</br>Say, Mr. Rose, for thou hast seen</br>Full many a sprightly race,</br>Obedient to thy violin,</br>The paths of pleasure trace;</br>Who foremost now delight to shine,</br>With pliant arms and pace divine?</br>The captive lover which enthrall?</br>How the coquette exerts her art</br>To win some Macaroni heart,</br>Yet flirts in vain with all?</br>Some bold adventurers despise</br>The joys that homebred misses prize,</br>And unknown dances dare descry,</br>Still as they dance, they look behind,</br>Admiring crowds with pleasure find,</br>And snatch an envied joy:</br>Alas!  regardless of their doom,</br>No grief their mind affects:</br>They neither dread old age to come,</br>Nor see their own defects.</br>Not onethroughout the happy place</br>Is conscious of an ugly face;</br>Yet see on every bench around</br>What numbers of them may be found,</br>Ridiculous, unseemly sights:</br>Ah!  tell them, that in spite of dress,</br>They still are preys to ugliness;</br>Ah!  tell them they are frights.</br>Beauty in this begins to fade,</br>(Here nature's been uncivil)</br>And these the fell small pox has made</br>As ugly as the devil.</br>The endless nose, projecting chin,</br>The mouth from ear to ear,</br>The shape deform'd, and yellow skin,</br>Are all assembled here.</br>But, lo!  in charms of youthful bloom,</br>A heav'nly troop is seen,</br>Fair beauty's daughters deck the room,</br>More lovely than their queen.</br>To each their joys, thro' different ways</br>To admiration prone;</br>The handsome pleas'd with others' praise,</br>The ugly with their own:</br>And wherefore should they know their fate,</br>Since sorrow never comes too late,</br>And should destroy their paradise;&mdash;</br>No more; where ignorance is bliss</br>'Tis folly to be wise.</br>"]
